Let’s just say, the Russian is not the Dutch official's biggest fan.</p><p><b>READ MORE:</b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#> <b>Derelict Euro 2028 stadium 'may not be finished in time' with 'big questions' over funding</b></a></p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>'Everyone thinks I punched Gary Lineker – here's the truth of what really happened'</a></b></p><p>In 2019, Slutsky went on one of the most spectacular refereeing rants ever seen in European football. At the time, he was managing Eredivisie side and former <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Chelsea</a> loan-signing addicts Vitesse Arnhem.</p><p>In a tense and tetchy 3-3 draw against PSV Eindhoven, Vitesse’s Maikel van der Werff was given a straight red card after committing a foul in the penalty area. Mexican international Hirving Lozano stepped up and dispatched the spot-kick to claim a late point for PSV.</p><p>This decision was made without the use of VAR. After the game, a raging Slutsky strode up for his post-match interview and tore the referee apart. “In each game in Eredivisie I never think about the referee,” he yelled. “Absolutely top level, <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Champions League</a> level.</p><p><b><i>Do you think Scotland can secure another victory against Spain?

He is like a waiter. Yes, he must be around the game because he is the referee. It is the players who are the most important people here. He thinks he is the most important. Absolutely the worst referee in the world that I have seen in my life.”</p><p>Slutsky was only just getting started. “All referees are very open, very friendly, smile, joke, shake hands,” he continued. “He [Gozubuyuk] never said hello, he never said goodbye and he never shook hands. He is arrogant. He is too selfish. He thinks he is God and all 21,000 people have come to watch his game, which is not his game.”</p><p>Maybe to save himself from a posse of, in Slutsky’s words “fat and bald people,” Gozubuyuk made a public statement to counter Slutsky’s rant. “All my friends can confirm that I have no hostility towards fat or bald people,” the referee wrote - yes seriously! “After the press conference, I even had the feeling that I was working at another match.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30976634.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_tnt.jpg><p>“The statement that I don’t shake hands with anyone is just stupid. I talked with commentators for ten minutes and even talked with Slutsky’s assistant. He himself ignored me. All this has gone too far, I consider the words spoken unacceptable. Let the federation make the decision.”</p><p>Gozubuyuk started his referee career in 2001 and he mainly plies his trade in the Eredivisie. In the 2014-15 season, he was named the best referee in Holland.</p><p>The 37-year-old was also the youngest Dutch international referee in history when he made his debut in the middle of the park in the Eredivisie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cL%2FPmqCnZaOYvLW4wKebZqqVm7KzscRmnZqsXaWysLzLnmRsaWFsfXKDlg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jimmy-o-yang.html><span>←</span><span>Jimmy O.
