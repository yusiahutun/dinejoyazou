Athletes can also apply rotations to control the path that the stones will take.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both teams take alternate turns delivering a set of eight stones to the house.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Points are calculated at the end of each round with most competitions being played over 10 rounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/01/31cdf77d-b7d9-4a9b-8552-be5476310003_e42c8a7a.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Team composition</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The number of people on a curling team depends on the discipline, with traditional events requiring four people, while mixed doubles teams only need one man and one woman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Each team has a team captain – known as a skip – who handles the team’s strategy, often by shouting instructions from the house. When the skip is delivering a stone, the vice-skip takes over.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Athletes in each team have an order in which they deliver their stones. They are the lead, second, third and fourth respectively.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/01/d3dca2a3-c9b0-49b1-9078-b1ac4f77f79b_abd27363.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">What’s with all the sweeping?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Curling is played on an ice sheet sprinkled with water droplets creating “pebbled ice”, which reduces friction between the stone and ice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Using specially designed brushes, the sweeping warms the surface of the ice allowing the stone to better glide across. If done well, the distance that a stone will travel could be extended by 2 to 3 metres, in addition to having a straighter trajectory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Curlers also wear special shoes to navigate the ice, with one shoe gripping the ice and another for sliding across. This allows athletes to slide with the stone on delivery or while sweeping.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/01/19af60db-f0fa-4d19-944b-c12006b68830_bf87c9a4.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Where did it originate from?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The exact origins of the sport are unclear, but the first written evidence of a similar game being played dates back to the year 1540 in Scotland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first recognised curling clubs were also from Scotland, with the sport being exported abroad in the 19th century as Scottish people moved overseas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Making its debut at the first Winter Olympics in 1924, curling was kept as a demonstration sport at the 1932, 1988 and 1992 Games. It was only added to the Olympic programme at the 1998 Nagano games.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Originally played on frozen lochs and ponds, competitions have now moved indoors, where the condition of rinks can be kept consistent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/01/f9d30b82-61de-481e-89f1-51d7d8cabda9_df5dbbd9.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Which countries should I watch out for?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Canada is one of the most successful countries in the event, with six golds among its total of 11 Olympic medals. Canadian curlers have also won multiple world championships in different curling disciplines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sweden is another curling powerhouse, with three gold medals among its total of eight. The Scandinavian country is currently ranked No 1 in the men’s and women’s game by the World Curling Federation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Norway is another country to watch, but for a completely different reason, with their team having gained international fame for their brightly-coloured trousers at previous Olympic Games.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The outfits have remained popular with fans despite the team announcing their break-up in 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr6a1yaKloGWnnru1sdFmpqWxnaW2pL%2BMa2dral%2BaxbG4wKKlnqqjZK6zwMico55nY2aDdoGQcmawoZ6psrN5zqWwpqiZmMBuw8eaq2abpae5qrrGZp%2Bor12Ytaa%2F0magnJ0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steven-tylers-daughter-and-grandson-barely-made-it-out-of-maui-wildfires.html><span>←</span><span>Steven Tyler's daughter and grandson 'barely made it out' of Maui wildfires</span></a>
