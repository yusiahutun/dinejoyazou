But before you pick up your next product, it's probably a good idea to do a little research on which chemical exfoliant will most satisfy your skin type, its needs, and concerns. Because let's face it, the last thing any of us needs right now is for our skin to start flaring up due to a bad reaction to a new product. To help us out, we reached out to three top dermatologists to get the facts — straight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling for everything you'll ever need to know about chemical exfoliants.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-most-common-types-of-chemical-exfoliants></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are the Most Common Types of Chemical Exfoliants?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), and polyhydroxy acids (PHAs) are among the most popular. "Alpha hydroxy acids include glycolic, lactic, and mandelic acid," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Elyse Love</a>, a board-certified New York City-based dermatologist. "Beta hydroxy acid is synonymous with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>salicylic acid</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are also PHAs. "Examples include gluconolactone and gluconic acid," shares Dr. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Joshua Zeichner</a>, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-difference-between-ahas-bhas-and-phas></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Difference Between AHAs, BHAs, and PHAs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Although AHAs and BHAs are both hydroxy acids, they differ in their composition and mechanism of action," explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Tess Mauricio</a>, a San Diego-based dermatologist. "Alpha hydroxy acids are water soluble substances that act as a chemical instead of a physical exfoliant like a scrub. It allows exfoliation of the skin and improved penetration of products. Beta hydroxy acids are lipid soluble and penetrate the skin through the oil glands. BHA tends to be preferred in skin conditions like acne where oil production is part of the disease process."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">PHAs, on the other hand, have a larger chemical structure than AHAs, making them ideal for those with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sensitive skin</a>. "They even have humectant properties, helping to hydrate the skin," says Dr. Zeichner.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-it-a-good-idea-to-mix-chemical-exfoliants></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is It a Good Idea to Mix Chemical Exfoliants?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It depends. Mixing acids can make certain treatments more effective, but you should avoid doing this on your own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Since each exfoliant interacts with the skin in slightly different ways and provides slightly different benefits, exfoliants can be combined to provide multiple benefits with one treatment and/or more intense benefits with one treatment," Dr. Love says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But if you want to go this route, it's best to leave it to the professionals to do the work for you. "Using too high a concentration of a single acid may be too irritating," Dr. Zeichner says. Dr. Love adds that there are many products on the market that offer safe combination formulas for at-home use — so your best bet is to stick with those.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-which-acids-are-best-for-sensitive-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Which Acids Are Best for Sensitive Skin?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your skin is prone to sensitivity, Dr. Zeichner recommends sticking with PHAs since they are more gentle on the skin and offer hydrating benefits. Dr. Mauricio suggests that depending on your skin needs, using low concentrations of AHAs or BHAs can also suffice. "Salicylic acid at lower concentration is preferred for sensitive skin," she says. "A lower concentration <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>glycolic acid</a> exfoliant can also be well tolerated by those with sensitive skin. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Lactic acid</a> is effective in treating dry skin."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-often-should-i-be-applying-chemical-exfoliants-to-my-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Often Should I Be Applying Chemical Exfoliants to My Skin?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Stronger agents should be used two to four times a month, while daily options may be incorporated into the skincare routine on a daily to weekly basis," says Dr. Love. However, for those with darker skin tones, be mindful of any developing irritation and halt use if you notice your skin seems to be flaring up. Irritation from these acids can lead to hyperpigmentation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-will-it-take-to-see-results></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Will It Take to See Results?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let's just say if you're looking for an instant or overnight treatment, this is your best bet. "Glycolic acid tends to deliver instant exfoliation which is one of the reasons it is very popular," Dr. Mauricio shares. "The exfoliation that happens can result in instantly brighter, fresher, and smoother skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, not all acids are built the same. "PHAs are slower to work because they have a more gentle effect on the skin," says Dr. Zeichner, adding that in the end, they will all give you the same results.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-which-chemical-exfoliants-do-dermatologists-recommend></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Which Chemical Exfoliants Do Dermatologists Recommend?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are a plethora of products on the market that offer chemical exfoliation benefits. But no matter which one you choose, make sure to consult with your dermatologist prior to use to ensure that it will work for your unique skin type. Here are a few of the MDs' go-tos:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>No7 Laboratories Resurfacing Skin Paste</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For those who are looking for an affordable over-the-counter product with effective chemical exfoliants, I like to recommend the No7 Laboratories Resurfacing Skin Paste," Dr. Mauricio shares.
