The portfolio comprised shares in companies, start-ups and joint ventures previously held by the Singapore government such as a bird park, a hotel, a start-up airline, and an iron and steel mill.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">As it happened: no mention of ‘0+0’ in Hong Kong policy address</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Lee explained that the companies targeted by the new fund would not be limited to tech firms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said a new board, made up of professionals and experts, would advise the financial secretary on what companies to attract and co-invest in. They hoped that by attracting famous corporations to Hong Kong, others in the global business community would have more confidence in the city, Lee added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee’s administration will also set up the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES) to be led by Chan for attracting strategic enterprises from the mainland and overseas by offering them special facilitation measures such as land, tax and financing as well as one-stop services including visa applications and education arrangements for their children.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The office, which appears to mirror Singapore’s Economic Development Board in scope, will be established within this year and tasked with attracting high-potential enterprises from around the globe, particularly those from industries of strategic importance, such as life and health technology, artificial intelligence and data science, financial technology (fintech), and advanced manufacturing and new energy technology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/10/19/LongVer_Clean.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It will also launch dedicated teams in the government’s mainland offices and overseas Economic and Trade Offices to proactively reach out to businesses and talent to persuade them to pursue development in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Economist Simon Lee Siu-po, an honorary fellow at the Asia-Pacific Institute of Business at Chinese University, said it was obvious Hong Kong had drawn on the experience of Temasek by setting up the Co-Investment Fund.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong has been lagging far behind Singapore in terms of setting up its own investment fund. It should have been done a long time ago,” he said. “The government may need to wait for at least 10 years to see good returns.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee said that despite the government seemingly deviating from its non-interventionist approach, the move was justified and necessary in times of adversity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I won’t call the government an interventionist. When it is now facing a deficit of over HK$100 billion, it needs to find other financial means to increase its income,” he said. “This is the right move.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">John Lee’s promises could start ‘new chapter’ for Hong Kong, but can he deliver?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Biomedical scientist Ricky Chiu Yin-to, chairman and chief executive officer of biotech company Phase Scientific, welcomed the establishment of the HKIC and called for more aggressive investments.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This ‘Hong Kong version of Temasek’ is a good way of thinking and we should have a company like this here. I really wish there were enough voices and investors with great vision to make some risk-taking decisions on potential companies,” Chiu said, adding the government tended to play safe on investment in the past.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yuen Mo, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong, said the establishment of OASES and the Co-Investment Fund was critical for industries including health tech, artificial intelligence and data science to widen the foundation of Hong Kong’s economy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Widening corporate investment and talent acquisition are the key elements to boost the Hong Kong economy. It also helps to create more jobs and enhances the attractiveness of Hong Kong as an international metropolis,” Yuen said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/19/d64ebaac-7764-44f7-9d0f-634ff1d96588_c7092b25.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee also announced six transport infrastructure projects – three rail links and three highways – to complement the development of the proposed Northern Metropolis, a massive economic, infrastructure and IT hub that is promised to create thousands of new jobs and homes, as well as economic integration with the mainland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They include bringing forward detailed planning and route design for the Hong Kong-Shenzhen West Rail Link connecting Hung Shui Kiu and Qianhai, the economic zone in Shenzhen; a proposed Central Rail Link which will connect Yuen Long with Kowloon Tong via Kwai Chung; and the construction of the Sha Tin Bypass linking Tai Po with Kowloon West.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The others are the Northern Metropolis Highway connecting Tin Shui Wai in the northwestern New Territories and Kwu Tung North in the east via San Tin, the TKO-Yau Tong Tunnel and the TKO Line Southern Extension to TKO Area 137.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">John Lee sets targets to enhance Hong Kong hub amid challenge from Singapore</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Separately, the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau said it would attract no fewer than 100 high-potential I&T enterprises to set up or expand their businesses in the city in the next five years, including at least 20 top-notch firms by collaborating with OASES and utilising the HK$5 billion Strategic Tech Fund as well as the land and space provided in the Lok Ma Chau Loop.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bureau will also earmark HK$10 billion to launch the “Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme” next year. It will fund at least 100 research teams in universities that have good potential to become start-ups on a matching basis.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Tony Cheung</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZon6iml2K4sLrGZpycp56kurp7wKuropucmnx0fZhvbGxuX528r7OMpKann12prqy1zaBkpZ2Rm3q0tc2gmKmnoprAbrzLmrCbp5%2BgeqavzqemprFdn7ypuoylnJ5lkaO7sMHNnJysZZmjw6a%2F06acp6xdpMK1ssitZKaZm5p6o7HTrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./6623273a321adf002542ad22-directo-html.html><span>←</span><span>Checo Prez en Gran Premio de China 2024</span></a>
