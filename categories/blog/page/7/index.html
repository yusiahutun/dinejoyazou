The big reveal about A's identity pretty much floored every Pretty Little Liars fan, and I'm still not sure how to cope with the idea thatCharles aka Big A could be Jason's twin. Not only is Charles a total mystery to us, he's also a little crazier than I expected. Sure, A wasn't going to a particularly sane person, but I don't think I'm just speaking for myself when I say there was no way to know just how far the depths of A's insanity reached.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Honoring Maya Angelou</h2><time>Sep 27, 2024</time>

This week the world lost one of its great lights, an autobiographer, an essayist, a poet, a mother, an advocate, inaugural speaker, producer, television writer, teacher in the broadest sense. Maya Angelou left the world at 86-years old, her presence will be greatly missed, but her legacy endures. "I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel,"</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jason Aldean Extends 2020 We Back Tour With Summer Dates</h2><time>Sep 27, 2024</time>

It was date night for Sofía Vergara and Justin Saliman on Friday, which means two things: We get to obsess over their developing relationship once again, and we have another lesson in evening-out dressing from the Colombian icon.
The Griselda star stepped out in what might be her most casual date-night look yet—but don’t worry, in true Vergara fashion, it was still glamorous. She championed the return of a controversial trend—skinny jeans—and made them look so good.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A Guide To The Best Petite Jeans For Short Legs</h2><time>Sep 26, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../a-guide-to-the-best-petite-jeans-for-short-legs.html></a>
As a person who stands at 5’3″, I understand firsthand the struggle of finding a solid pair of jeans that doesn’t need further alteration besides the usual cuff. While I’ve personally become very comfortable with buying regular-length denim and slicing the bottoms with a pair of fabric shears, I get that not everyone is into the frayed hem look. Additionally, not everyone has the budget or time to take their pants to a tailor who can preserve the original hem on their jeans.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>EXCLUSIVE: Republican dropout Tim Scott's new girlfriend Mindy Noce and her ex-husband Peter were su</h2><time>Sep 26, 2024</time>

At the same time, she was divorcing her former spouse, blaming the collapse of their marriage on his heavy drinking and opioid abuse.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rihanna &amp;amp; PartyNextDoor 'Believe It' Lyrics Meaning: Who's It About?</h2><time>Sep 26, 2024</time>

The Killers are a singles band, and a damn good one when they apply themselves, but front man Brandon Flowers has never been content to be only that. He’s been pushing his band toward the rarefied precipice of rock greatness for over a decade now, releasing albums at a faster clip than their general quality suggests is wise, and crisscrossing the world on exhausting tours to back them up.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/6/>← Prev Page</a>
