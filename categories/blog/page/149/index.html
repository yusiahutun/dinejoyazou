<a href=../../../../target-open-story-luggage-review.html></a>
For years, I relied on my parents to supply my luggage when traveling. In college, I made the ~very grown up~ decision to treat myself to some discounted suitcases from T.J. Maxx. Fast-forward to 2020, and I’ve amassed quite a few nice bags from luggage brands like Away and Béis, so I feel I’m more than qualified to deliver a Target Open Story luggage review.

Earnest and straightforward, John Chu Ka-yan's film - a morality tale about a spoilt brat's education about the virtues of hard work - has no sensational gimmicks or thinly veiled metaphors. Sadly, it also lacks a meaty storyline, the occasional edgy moment or even an element of surprise that would make The Magic Gourd more than a day out for schoolchildren.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Jade Eshete dating?
