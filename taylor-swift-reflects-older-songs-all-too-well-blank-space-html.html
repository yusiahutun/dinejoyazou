However, few will pass up the opportunity to talk about old hits, especially those from her early <a href=#>country days</a>. And Swift will happily oblige when she’s able. Here’s what she’s saying about a few of her previous songs.</p><h2>Taylor Swift’s has put out her seventh album</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-2_46>Swift’s new album, Lover, is a massive hit. Like her previous ones, it has broken numerous records, some of which were her own. It was released on Aug. 23, 2019, and is also a first for the artist: She owns all of the master recordings.</p><p id=par-3_40>The impressive 18-track album boasts singles “Me!,” “You Need to Calm Down,” “The Archer,” and “Lover.” Other songs that have earned attention are the metaphorical “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince” and the Dixie Chicks collaboration “Soon You’ll Get Better.”</p><h2>What are some of her old hits?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/taylor-swift-blank-space.jpg><p id=par-4_62>Swift has had a lot of hits throughout her 13-year career in the music business. First was her self-titled debut in 2006, which was marked by singles “Teardrops On My Guitar” and “Picture to Burn.” Then came 2008’s Fearless, with hits like “Love Story” and “Fifteen.” Next up was 2010’s Speak Now, featuring “Back to December” and “Mean,” which won a Grammy.</p><p id=par-5_61>Her final country album, Red, was a transitional one, and featured “We Are Never Ever Getting Back to Together” and “I Knew You Were Trouble.” Next was 2014’s 1989 (the year Swift was born), her first official pop record, with singles like “Shake It Off” and “Bad Blood.” Finally, she broke her every-other-year pattern by putting out <a href=#>Reputation</a> in 2017.</p><h2>How ‘Black Space’ was a prelude to her next album</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_47>When Swift made her <a href=#>Reputation</a>, she channeled her emotions from the past year or so of her life. She told Rolling Stone that the idea of writing as the “character” that people made her out to be was something fairly new to her, but not entirely.</p><p id=par-7_49>“The only way I’d done it in the past, was with ‘Blank Space,’ which I wrote specifically about criticisms I had received for supposedly dating too many people in my twenties.” <a href=#>Swift</a> is referring to a single off 1989, which many quickly recognized was satirical in many ways.</p><h2>Swift sang ‘All Too Well’ on tour</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-8_47>Like many artists, Swift enjoys bringing back old hits when she goes on tour for each album. And sometimes, she’s surprised by which songs people want to hear, saying, “I think it often takes a lot of time for people to understand how they feel about music.”</p><p id=par-9_70>She continued. “I know that now because there’s a song on [her 2012 album] Red called ‘All Too Well’ that I’m really, really proud of, and it took people about three years to note that that was one of the best songs. I didn’t see that starting to pop up when people would talk about my music until about two or three years after the album had its moment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBosXLqKlmq6ees7V50Z6dpZ2TqcBuu8udnKtlo6S7qL%2BMmqOlZaSkvG7DxKWjZpqclrusedKpmJydXp3BrriO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-man-creator-real-life-son-appears-in-new-series.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Man star's real-life son appears in new Netflix drama get the details</span></a>
