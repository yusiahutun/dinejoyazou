For every color, there is a sound, a vibration, a part of the human body, a number, a musical note…You have all of your chakras, you have the pituitary, the pineal, the thymus thyroid, the adrenal and the gonad, and so on (which correspond to colors).”</p><p>He added:</p><p>This process is like riding a moped – you have to peddle first to fire it up. What gives me meditation is the shower. When I get in the shower, because of something called sensory deprivation – when one of your senses is being blocked, it allows your mind to wander and be imaginative. So when I’m in the shower, the water blocks out the sound, so it makes me imagine things.”</p><h2><span id=Pharrell_is_8217embarrassed8217_by_the_lyrics_of_Blurred_Lines>Pharrell is ’embarrassed’ by the lyrics of Blurred Lines</span></h2><p>The song titled Blurred Lines is about the sexist culture and he got embarrassed when his song was banned from many universities as well as DayTime Tv. He talked with GQ Magazine about the song saying:</p><p>“Some of my old songs, I would never write or sing today. I get embarrassed by some of that stuff. It just took a lot of time and growth to get to that place. Blurred Lines was the turning point for him but he admitted that at first, he didn’t get why the song received such a backlash from some.
