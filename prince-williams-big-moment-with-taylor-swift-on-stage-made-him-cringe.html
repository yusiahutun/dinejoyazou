Prince William may regret his decision now, but the 41-year-old <a href=#>royal</a> recalled how he got up like a ‘puppy’ when the hitmaker asked him to join them on stage at the Centrepoint charity event at Kensington Palace a decade back.</p><p>Recounting the special event, William <a href=# rel=nofollow>shared</a>: “I’m sat next to&nbsp;Taylor Swift. She’s on my left. And after Jon (Bon Jovi) does his first song, there’s a pause, and she turns to me.</p><p>“She puts her hand on my arm, looks me in the eye, and says, ‘Come on, William. Let’s go and sing.’”</p><p>Just a simple request from the 34-year-old <a href=#>celebrity</a> was enough for Prince William to be convinced.</p><p>He admitted: “To this day, I still do not know what came over me. Honestly, even now I’m cringing at what happened next, and I don’t understand why I gave in.</p><p>“But, frankly, if&nbsp;Taylor Swift&nbsp;looks you in the eye, touches your arm, and says, ‘Come with me…’ I got up like a puppy and went, ‘Yeah, okay, that seems like a great idea. I’ll follow you’.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-tricky-moment-on-stage>The tricky moment on stage</h2><p>The viral clip of Prince William singing flawlessly with two music icons may not tell the full story of what happened behind the scenes. The older brother of <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> confessed he did not know the full lyrics of Bon Jovi’s Livin’ On a Prayer but sang ‘as hard’ as he could!</p><p>He admitted: “I walked up on stage in a trance, and then sort of halfway through Jon Bon Jovi’s “Livin’ On a Prayer” song, I wake up, And I’m thinking to myself, ‘Am I standing on the stage singing ‘Livin’ On a Prayer’ when I don’t even know the words?'”</p><p>The festive mood and an easy crowd made it easier for the Prince to make his performance appear flawless.</p><p>He added: “But the Centrepoint young guys and girls were there all loving it and cheering away. So I thought, ‘Well, if they’re enjoying it, then the night is for them. So sod it. I can’t be the doofus who’s going to ruin it for everyone.”</p><p>All’s well that ends well and Prince William struggled to keep his composure until the end of his performance.</p><p>“And so I desperately try and remember some of the words and sing as hard as I can,” the dad-of-two added. “Beneath my black tie, there was a lot of sweating going on. I felt like a swan, where I was trying to keep myself composed on the outside, but inside, the little legs are paddling fast.”</p><p>While the Prince of Wales did not have it easy on stage, his efforts paid off massively as till date, fans can’t help but swoon over the throwback clips of the trio’s epic stage.</p><p><a href=#>TikTok</a> is filled with viral clips of the epic night, as one fan commented (summarizing all of our feelings): “The trio I did not know I needed.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aFcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkrGWSnrRuuc6mnKesXay2tbSMrZiypJ%2BnerTDyJ%2BrZqeeYsC1rcaeZKaZlJp6qbXMZpqroZ6csnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heartwarming-moment-taylor-swift-gifts-signed-22-hat-to-five-year-old-little-girl.html><span>←</span><span>Heartwarming moment Taylor Swift gifts signed 22 hat to five-year-old little girl</span></a>
