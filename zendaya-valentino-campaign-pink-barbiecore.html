What makes you feel good and confident? I want you to do that.' I appreciate that because it is Valentino, after all. It's not a small deal."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=efrUzSI_Znfb data-wc=21>"The idea of Pink as a barrier breaker was born long ago," said Pierpaolo, explaining his reasoning behind the colour choice.</p><p id=evCuDYG70UWY data-wc=86>"With my work I must be able to tell and share my values through one single picture and I wanted to apply the same paradigm to one colour. As a consequence, it was almost natural to me to look (and find) something that could embrace the need for expression and representation of a new and liberated humanity. I chose Zendaya and Lewis for the Pink PP for the same reason I created this colour, beautiful souls that use their voice and talent to unify, integrate, build."</p><p id=e8QwmR4opE5v data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5FpaWtoaGWBcoCWa3BsZ6qau6Wt2Jpkr5mcmru1tc2oZJyZnaWuqrPNZqeipptir6K%2BwaKcnKeimnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-fraud-bio-age-job-net-worth-vanessa-villela.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Tom Fraud?
