Prices for concert tickets have risen to a point where they are unaffordable for most people. For example, if you want to buy tickets to see Hong Kong boy band Mirror through public sales, you could spend between HK$480 to HK$1,280.
But this is nothing compared to how much ticket scalpers sell them for – some reports say people have sold Mirror tickets for up to HK$438,000."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We could limit the number of times an individual can buy tickets to a certain band or musician’s concert series. This way, we could stop some fans from going to more than one concert in a series, so other people can buy tickets.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Some would argue that using your real name would put your personal information at risk. However, the two most common websites used to buy concert tickets in Hong Kong, Urbtix and HK Ticketing, both have industry-level security standards.
