That's not a purchase — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>that's an investment</a>, one that should be made solely in a high-quality style that'll stay with you for years. But when my best friend, who works at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored noskim nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Stuart Weitzman</a>, told me she spent her own money on the classic 5050s and was genuinely obsessed, the unimaginable became reality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This friend had (generously) gifted me sample sale <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noskim nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Stuart Weitzman booties</a> in the past, so I was familiar with the brand's luxurious fit and feel. But this was my first <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored noskim nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">over-the-knee Stuart Weitzman</a> — the boots that get all the hype. They're made from baby-smooth premium leather, which, if taken good care of, stays that way over time, and they have a stretchy fabric around the calf that helps them stay in place. And four years later, these boots are still my winter staple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How well my Stuart Weitzman 5050 Boots have held up still surprises me, especially because I've worn (and still wear) them everywhere. Back in the day, I would walk my two-mile commute from Midtown to the Upper West Side in them, and rather than rubbing into my heels and leaving my toes blistered, never once did they leave a mark. Instead, they were so comfortable that I actually looked forward to wearing them over my sneakers.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$795; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noskim nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">nordstrom.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They keep my ankles warm and offer plenty of support. So much so that when I backpacked through Europe, I even hiked the Swiss Alps in them! The snow had nothing on the boots' warmth, and my pictures turned out really cute, if I do say so myself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because one is never enough, I've picked up more of the brand's over-the-knee boots since, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noskim nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Stuart Weitzman 5050 Lift Boot</a>, which is shown above and currently available at Nordstrom. The Lift Boot has all of the same great features as the classic 5050, but it comes up slightly higher above the knee and has a lift lug sole. (Nordstrom also has a wholesale-exclusive version of the 5050, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored noskim nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">The Maddox</a>, and it's on sale for $300 off right now.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With their stretchy over-the-knee silhouette and small platform heel, Stuart Weitzman boots fit me like a glove and elevate any outfit. I love how I can keep them casual with a sweater and jeans or dress them up with a skirt. No matter where I'm heading I know I look sophisticated, and I have these boots to thank for the instant confidence boost.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I am normally a size 6.5 in most shoes, but in Stuart Weitzmans, I size down to a 5.5. I find that there isn't much room for thick socks, and I don't think that would change if I wore my regular size, but I promise you won't really need them since they're already warm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And finally, if you want your Stuart Weitzman boots to last, make sure you take care of them. If you also traipse through snowy European mountains in them, wipe them off with a towel once you get inside. Once, I got a pretty bad nick on the front of the shoe, but taking them to my shoe repair place was an easy solve — they also shined them, and I swear they came back looking brand new. And when I travel, I always place them inside the cloth bag they came in, and when I'm home, I store them under my bed lying flat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The perfect shoe really does exist, and it's made by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noskim nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Stuart Weitzman</a>. In my opinion, the over-the-knee boots are worth every penny.
