Thankfully, unc0ver recently launched v6.x of its jailbreak software, which added support for up to iOS 14.3, as well as the 2020 iPhone lineup.</p><p>You won't find unc0ver on the App Store, so read on for the latest installation tutorial as we show you how to jailbreak your iPhone.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=what-is-jailbreaking>What Is Jailbreaking?</h2><p>Jailbreaking is the process of cracking into your iPhone to bypass the usual iOS restrictions. This lets you install software on your phone from developers that can't publish to the App Store. The main reason people choose to jailbreak is for more customization options.</p><p>To jailbreak your iPhone, you have to go through the process of installing Cydia on your device. If you're wondering if jailbreaking is right for you, we've previously looked at <a href=#>whether or not you should jailbreak</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>It is worth noting that jailbreaking your iPhone can leave it open to security vulnerabilities in apps, software, and iOS itself. In some cases, if you have a problem with your iPhone, Apple may not fix it if your device is jailbroken.</p><p>Also, once you have jailbroken, you cannot update your iPhone without needing to re-jailbreak. You won't be able to do this if there is no jailbreak for the new version of iOS.</p><h2 id=before-you-start-jailbreaking>Before You Start Jailbreaking</h2><p>This jailbreaking tutorial requires a couple of elements. You're going to need the following:</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><ul><li>A computer</li><li>Your iPhone</li><li>An Apple ID Account</li><li>A Lightning cable</li><li>The unc0ver Download</li><li>iTunes (if you're using Windows)</li><li>No pending <a href=#>updates waiting on your iPhone</a></li><li>A recent <a href=#>backup of your iPhone</a> before jailbreaking, in case something goes wrong</li></ul><p>It's worth noting that a Mac is the easiest platform for completing the jailbreak process. If you have access to a Mac, we recommend using that computer. Whichever platform you use, though, you'll need some additional programs for the jailbreak. We'll show you how to download these and what to do with them in the relevant tutorial.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Your iPhone can be running any version of iOS between 11.0 and 14.3 for this method. At some point, you'll need to download the latest version of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unc0ver</a> on your iPhone. The site has an FAQ section for any questions you might have.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Unc0ver-Site-Homepage.png><p>Note that there are no official iPhone-only methods for jailbreaking at this time. Thus, you will need a computer for the jailbreak process. Be wary of any websites that offer an iPhone-only method of jailbreaking.</p><p>Nnow that you've got everything that you need to jailbreak your iPhone, let's get started.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=how-to-jailbreak-your-iphone-using-a-mac>How to Jailbreak Your iPhone Using a Mac</h2><p>There are few different methods to install the jailbreak using macOS; we're going to show you the easiest way to do it. This doesn't require downloading the giant 9GB Xcode or having a paid Apple Developer account.</p><p>To start, download <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AltStore</a> for Mac.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AltStore-Homepage.png><p>Once the file has downloaded, unzip the file from your <strong>Downloads</strong> folder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AltStore-Add-Mail-1-e1615238623468.png><p>Once unzipped, move the new AltStore app to your <strong>Applications</strong> folder. Go ahead and launch AltStore once you've done this.</p><p>Now that you've got AltStore open, click on its icon in the Menu Bar, which looks like a diamond with curved edges. Then click <strong>Install Mail Plug-in</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mail-Preferences.png><p>You'll then need to click <strong>Allow</strong> and enter your password. After this, open the Mail app and go to <strong>Mail > Preferences</strong>. Once there, open the <strong>General</strong> tab followed by <strong>Manage Plug-ins</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AltStore-iPhone-1.png><p>Once this window opens, tick the box next to <strong>AltPlugin</strong>, then click apply. You now need to restart Mail by closing and re-opening it.</p><p>Now, connect your iPhone using its cable. Once connected, click <strong>AltStore</strong> in the menu bar on your Mac, then go to <strong>Install AltStore</strong> and choose your iPhone. Log in with your Apple ID (or create a new one, if you wish) when prompted, then click <strong>Install</strong>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Next, open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone. Go to <strong>General > Device Management</strong> and tap on your Apple ID. Select the <strong>Trust AltStore</strong> option. After this, open the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unc0ver</a> site on your iPhone and tap the <strong>Download</strong> button. Choose the option to <strong>Open with AltStore</strong>, then AltStore will install the app.</p><p>Finally, open the unc0ver app and tap <strong>Jailbreak</strong>.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Unc0ver-Screenshot.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AltStore-iPhone-1.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><h2 id=how-to-jailbreak-your-iphone-using-windows>How to Jailbreak Your iPhone Using Windows</h2><p>When using a Windows computer, there is an extra step in jailbreaking. You need to make sure you have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iTunes</a> on your device so that AltStore can work properly. It must be the standard desktop version of iTunes, not the Microsoft Store version.</p><p>Once again, we're showing you how to do the easier of the two methods, which doesn't require a paid Apple Developer account. To start, open iTunes on your PC; you can minimize it, but leave it open. Next, download <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AltStore</a> for Windows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AltStore-Homepage.png><p>Right-click the ZIP file that downloads and choose <strong>Extract All</strong>. In the extracted files, double-click <strong>Setup.exe</strong> to open it, then follow the on-screen instructions. Once that's done, connect your iPhone.</p><p>Next, on your computer press <strong>Win</strong> to open the search bar, type <strong>AltServer</strong>, and open the app. Click the diamond-shaped icon in your System Tray at the bottom-right corner; you may need to hit the arrow to show more icons. The icon will say <strong>AltServer</strong> when you hover over it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>From the options that appear, hover over <strong>Install AltStore</strong> and select your iPhone. Enter your Apple ID and password when prompted. If desired, you can create a new Apple ID for this step.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/iPhone-Home-Cydia-Screenshot.jpg><p>Now, open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone. Go to <strong>General > Device Management</strong> and tap on your Apple ID. Choose the <strong>Trust AltStore</strong> option.</p><p>Moving on, open the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unc0ver</a> site on your iPhone and tap the <strong>Download</strong> button. Choose the option to <strong>Open with AltStore</strong>; AltStore will now install the app. Finally, open the unc0ver app and tap <strong>Jailbreak</strong>.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Unc0ver-Screenshot.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AltStore-iPhone-1.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><h2 id=how-to-jailbreak-your-iphone-using-linux>How to Jailbreak Your iPhone Using Linux</h2><p>Unfortunately, the only method for the iPhone jailbreak process on a Linux computer requires a paid Apple Developer account. These accounts cost $99 per year, so it's a pricey fee to pay for the jailbreak.</p><p>To start, download <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cydia Impactor</a> for Linux, choosing the right download for your operating system.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Once downloaded, extract the application file and open it. You now need to connect your iPhone to your computer. Download the latest version of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unc0ver</a> to your computer. This will install an IPA file; drag the file into the Cydia Impactor window. Enter your Apple ID and password associated with the paid account.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Next, open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone. Go to <strong>General > Device Management</strong> and tap on your Apple ID. Click on the <strong>Trust Unc0ver</strong> option.

This is essentially a mini reboot of the springboard (home screen manager). You will see the Apple logo like a normal reboot at this point, followed by the Cydia application appearing on your Home screen.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Sometimes the jailbreak process may show you an error, or fail. If that happens, restart your phone, reopen the unc0ver app, and try to jailbreak it again. In case the app keeps failing to jailbreak your iPhone or seems stuck, you need to force-close the unc0ver app, restart your iPhone, turn on Airplane mode, and then try to jailbreak your iPhone again.</p><h2 id=your-iphone-is-now-jailbroken>Your iPhone Is Now Jailbroken!</h2><p>You've successfully walked through to jailbreak your iPhone. Now it's time to install some tweaks. Tweaks are mini apps that you can't usually install on your iPhone. You use Cydia to install these tweaks to your device. Through Cydia, it's possible to add repositories that store the tweaks, which you can then download them on your iPhone.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dqbxutsCio5uqlZa4brXPoaannV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lindsay-brewer-indy-500-model-28939225.html><span>←</span><span>Gorgeous racing ace shows off toned physique as she looks to realise Indy 500 dream</span></a>
