I remember when I first started, there was a cement floor and no air-conditioning. Fans had to bring their own paper fans to watch the games.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'But we all look forward to the new stadium. Hong Kong basketball deserves a better facility to develop the sport.' Ng, who led Regal to Asian Champions Cup victory in 1997, said he would remember the big timer. He showed every foreign player how it worked when they started for the first time at the stadium.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'It was a bit funny because they had never seen anything like that to keep time on a basketball court,' said Ng.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Marksman Yung Kam-wah said he would miss the mirror inside the changing room because that was the first thing the players saw when they arrived in the stadium.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'We are all familiar with the stadium as it has been used for such a long time,' he said.

'I still remember the night when we clinched the World Cup Invitation mixed doubles final here in 1979 and the overwhelming response from the crowd.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wang Yiu, senior stadium manager of the Playground Association which runs the centre, said the redevelopment would provide a more comfortable experience for spectators.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'All seats will change to cushioned armchairs instead of the existing bleachers and the capacity will remain about 1,750 so a similar number of fans can be entertained,' he said. 'The new multi-purpose stadium will not only be used by basketball, but also other non-sports events. Small pop concerts as well as exhibitions are also welcome.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">End of an era</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">MacPherson Stadium has been an integral part of Hong Kong's sporting landscape since it was opened in: 1953</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To the rafters</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">MacPherson Stadium was famous for its intimate atmosphere.
