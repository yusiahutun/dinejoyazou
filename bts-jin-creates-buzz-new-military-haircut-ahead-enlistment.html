The other six members of the group – RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, also have to perform military duty. The band’s agency, Big Hit Music, said it hopes they will reunite in 2025.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/10/17/CLEANThumb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:30</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Fans can’t keep calm as K-pop group BTS reunites for free concert after taking a break</p><p>Fans can’t keep calm as K-pop group BTS reunites for free concert after taking a break</p>BTS last played together in the middle of October at a concert in Busan, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">South Korea</span></a>. But, Jin’s last performance came a couple weeks later, joining British band Coldplay on stage in Buenos Aires, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Argentina</span></a>. It was during that show that Jin made his solo debut with the single, Astronaut. The track was co-written by Jin and Coldplay. During the performance, Jin and Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin hugged each other, in a sign of true friendship.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since that concert, Jin has been preparing for military life, which will begin on Tuesday, as he enters boot camp of a front-line Army division in Yeoncheon, 60 kilometres north of Seoul, according to Yonhap news agency. After undergoing basic training, he will reportedly be assigned to an undecided local military unit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jin will enter the Key Recruit Training Center of the 5th Infantry Division in Yeoncheon, along with about 200 other new recruits.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Jin of BTS to begin military service.

Jin’s agency also asked fans not to visit the military base, but instead to offer words of support as the musician “finishes his military service and comes back”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">News reports said police and local authorities were taking extra steps to prevent any accidents from crowding, mobilising some 270 riot police and 60 government employees to prevent any mishaps.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most of the new recruits including Jin are expected to enter the military grounds by cars through the gate, making it difficult for fans and journalists waiting outside to catch a glimpse of him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Street vendors and food trucks will be banned from near the entrance of the training centre and emergency rescuers will also be on standby, news reports said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGpraGJuhHp7wa2qZqKZo3qkvsSaq56rXZfCu8aMp5ywZZ2euarAwKuwZqCRnr%2BkwdNmmKGdkZl6prrLoqqtpZWjwQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./34-facts-about-jude-law.html><span>←</span><span>34 Facts About Jude Law</span></a>
