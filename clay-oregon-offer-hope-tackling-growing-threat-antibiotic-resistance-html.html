resistance.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Experts have warned even simple infections could become deadly if traditional medicines stop working.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-medium health-ccox">Blue clay can kill hard-to-get sticky bacteria</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This study is an important advance in understanding how clays, specifically blue clay from Oregon, have shown medicinal properties by attaching to bacteria,' said Enriqueta Barrera, from the National Science Foundation which funded the research.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As well as killing individual bacteria the clay could also destroy bacteria which become biofilms, which are created when bacteria stick together such as in dental plaque.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These can be especially difficult to get rid of because they create a protective coating, according to the researchers, but are found in two thirds of infections.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-medium health-ccox">'These results support efforts to design new drugs'</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Arizona State University's Lynda Williams said: 'We showed that these clays diminish populations of bacterial biofilms as well as bacteria common in wounds that are more resistant to drugs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The results support our efforts to design new antibacterial drugs using natural clays.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The scientists say it is early days for the research and more studies need to be done, but the results are promising.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Robin Patel from Mayo Clinic added: 'We showed that this reduced iron-bearing clay can kill some strains of bacteria under the laboratory conditions used, including bacteria grown as biofilms, which can be particularly challenging to treat.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The team's findings appear in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>WHAT IS ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE?&nbsp;</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:15px>Antibiotics have been doled out unnecessarily by GPs and hospital staff for decades, fueling once harmless bacteria to become superbugs.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously warned if nothing is done the world is heading for a 'post-antibiotic' era.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It claimed common infections, such as chlamydia, will become killers without immediate solutions to the growing crisis.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bacteria can become drug resistant when people take incorrect doses of antibiotics or if they are given out unnecessarily.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies claimed in 2016 that the threat of antibiotic resistance is as severe as terrorism.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Figures estimate that superbugs will kill 10 million people each year by 2050, with patients succumbing to once harmless bugs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Around 700,000 people already die yearly due to drug-resistant infections including tuberculosis (TB), HIV and malaria across the world.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Concerns have repeatedly been raised that medicine will be taken back to the 'dark ages' if antibiotics are rendered ineffective in the coming years.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In addition to existing drugs becoming less effective, there have only been one or two new antibiotics developed in the last 30 years.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In September, the WHO warned antibiotics are 'running out' as a report found a 'serious lack' of new drugs in the development pipeline.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Without antibiotics, C-sections, cancer treatments and hip replacements will become incredibly 'risky', it was said at the time.</p><p class=postsid
