In keeping with the James Bond theme, Turner looked every part the beautiful Bond girl in a plunging tuxedo-inspired gown by Alexandre Vauthier, complete with a built-in gold choker.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Coincidentally, famed Joe Jonas ex Taylor Swift also looked quite fetching in that very same gown in 2016 at the Vanity Fair Oscar party. Both women even opted for gold sandals, skipping the more obvious choice of classic black.</p><img alt="2016 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Hosted By Graydon Carter - Arrivals" title="2016 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Hosted By Graydon Carter - Arrivals" width=2000 height=3005 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-513006300-1566246850.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pascal Le Segretain</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We are, however, left to wonder why Turner would deign to don the same dress as her new husband's ex. Let's look at a timeline, shall we? The only true Joe in the JoBros dated Swift from July to October 2008 before breaking up with her during a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/joe-jonas-explains-split-from-taylor-swift/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="27-second phone call" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">27-second phone call</a>. We'll do the math for you, that's three months, when Jonas was not yet 20 years old.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair's quarter-of-a-year "relationship" and breakup resulted in three hit songs for Swift, the somewhat angry "Last Kiss" and "Forever and Always" followed by a healing melody, "Holy Ground," according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/photos/1484087/taylor-swifts-boyfriend-timeline-12-relationships-their-songs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Billboard class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Billboard</a>. In other words, Swift went straight from anger to acceptance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, perhaps, Turner doesn't even really consider Swift an ex. Three months of a college-age dalliance doesn't really count as dating in the real world, so much as a random hookup that lasted too long.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maybe she didn't realize Swift had also worn the Vauthier. Maybe she just didn't care and thought the gown looked too good to pass up. Maybe she thinks Swift got three songs out of three months with her then-teenage husband and she shouldn't get solo rights on a good dress, too. We're left with nothing but questions and this impactful side-by-side image.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Little Women: Official Trailer" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/little-women-epk-df-03669-03660-r-1565714577.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/89754333-a030-4699-b9fa-0dfa137fc094_1496780517.jpg alt="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" title="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Kerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.
