It will now be the main event after <strong>Jon Jones</strong> vs. <strong>Stipe Miocic</strong> had to be called off after an injury to the former. Prochazka is coming off of a year-long layoff due to an injury he suffered around this time last year. Let us take a look at what his injury was all about as we gear up for the UFC’s next pay-per-view at Madison Square Garden.</p><p><strong>Jamahal Hill</strong> recently suffered an Achilles injury that forced him to relinquish the light heavyweight title. This prompted <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Dana White</strong></a> to put the title up for grabs at UFC 295. When Prochazka vacated his title after his injury last year, the UFC top brass assured a title fight for him upon his return. As the light heavyweight title curse continues, let us take a look at the returning former champion and the circumstances of his long layoff.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Jiri Prochazka suffered a shoulder injury before his last fight</h2><p>‘The Czech Samurai’ made headlines in the MMA world after defeating the legendary <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Glover Teixeira</strong></a> at UFC 275 in a back-and-forth bloodbath. He won the UFC light heavyweight title in the process in only his third fight in Dana White’s promotion. Considering how close the Fight of the Year 2022 was, a rematch was the obvious choice.</p><p>While in preparation for his second meeting with Teixeira, Prochazka picked up a serious shoulder injury. The news made waves at the time due to the supposed seriousness of the mishap. Even UFC CEO Dana White at the time termed it the worst shoulder injury the UFC doctors had seen.</p><p>Jiri Prochazka later <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>vacated the light heavyweight title</a> and mentioned that he had to undergo surgery. Furthermore, he also indicated that he will be out for at least six months, which could extend up to a year. His manager, <strong>Tim Simpson</strong>, even <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>spoke to ESPN</a></strong> and mentioned that the Czech fighter decided to vacate the title. “It was actually Jiri’s decision”, said Simpson. He further elaborated how ‘Denisa’ came to that decision.</p><p>He added that Prochazka knew he’d be out for some time, and as such, decided to let the division move on and be fair to other fighters. Simpson added, “He has a Samurai way of life, and once he knew how long he would be out, he said, ‘I must respect the other fighters and let them fight for the belt.'”&nbsp;</p><p>The former champion himself would later go on ‘The MMA Hour’ by Ariel Helwani and explain the circumstances under which he picked up the injury.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Prochazka injured his shoulder after getting hit with a suplex</h2><p>After vacating the title, Jiri Prochazka made an appearance in an interview with <strong>Ariel Helwani</strong>. He opened up on how the injury took place, which he did not necessarily blame anyone for. He said,&nbsp;“It was a sparring session, but everything was light. Nobody did something wrong. But I just did some mistake.”</p><p>Prochazka was sparring with one of his partners when he accidentally let him take his back. That was followed by a suplex attempt from his sparring partner that led him to land awkwardly on his shoulder. Consequentially, he popped his shoulder and then he headed to the hospital. “I let the guy to take my back and he just throw me for the suplex right to the shoulder. And that was that,” said the 31-year-old.</p><p>‘The Czech Samurai’ is now back at his 100 percent. His last fight was a title match and he will be making his return to yet another title fight. It remains to be seen if he can overcome Alex Pereira to become a two-time light heavyweight champion or if the Brazilian becomes a two-division champion in a second promotion. We will have to wait and see how things unfold on November 11.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Is Dana White A Billionaire?
