His brother <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> who calls the US home, has been travelling around the world recently. But Harry too will be in the US when his big brother hits the shore.

He will be in the city for the second Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit on September 19. The big event will precede the upcoming 2023 Earthshot Prize awards ceremony, which will be hosted in Singapore on November 7th this year.</p><p>People <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">note</a> that the heir to the throne will be heading back to the UK shortly after his arrival in New York. He is set to return early to take over the royal duties while <a href=#>King Charles and Queen </a>consort Camilla depart for their overseas trip. Buckingham Palace recently announced that the British monarch will be in France from Sept 20 to Sept 22 for his state visit.</p><p>While Prince William isn’t really required to be in the UK when the King is traveling, he will be there to look after any duties that need to be done while his father is away. After all, <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>‘s husband is not just the King’s son and the heir but also the King’s Counsellor of State. For the unversed, the Counsellor of State has the authority to carry out most of the official duties when <a href=#>King Charles</a> is away or unwell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-76081926-835x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-of-wales-won-t-be-meeting-brother-prince-harry-in-the-us>Prince of Wales won’t be meeting brother Prince Harry in the US</h2><p>Prince Harry is set to visit London to attend the annual awards event for WellChild. He serves as the patron for the charity that works for seriously ill kids. Harry will attend the awards on September 7. Then from September 9 to 16, Harry will be at the Invictus Games taking place in Düsseldorf.</p><p>Given the two brothers’ commitments, the two may be in the US around the same time but sadly they don’t have any plans of meeting one another.</p><p>The royal rift between Diana’s two sons is well known. Their relations have been strained since Harry left the UK with wife <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> in 2020. Then the Sussexes Oprah Winfrey interview drew a wedge between them further deep. Furthermore Harry’s memoir Spare dealt the biggest blow to his bond with his big brother. While rumors that <a href=#>Harry and his father King Charles</a> are looking to reconcile their relationship have surfaced lately, there are no such talks about the brothers.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2WBcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZp6crravs4ytn6ito5a7pb%2BMqJ1mpZmhsrR506hkm51do7KivoyhmKuqqWKvtsCMpaCknZyueri7za1kr6GjnsFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./visit-taiwan-war-breaks-out-overseas-press-obsess-over-island-which-nevertheless-remains-charming.html><span>←</span><span>Opinion | Visit Taiwan before war breaks out?
