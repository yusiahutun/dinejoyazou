As a little boy, he loved to explore the woods and wildlife around his home, and his love of nature only grew as the boy became a man. He spent his time hunting, fishing and studying battles of the Civil War. He could often be found volunteering at the equine rescue near his mother’s home in Virginia, having inherited his talent for working with horses from his beloved Pawpaw. He was an active member of the Myrick Assembly of God Church.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He was preceded in death by his grandfather Robin Powell Sr.; his grandmother Paula Powell; his grandfather H.L. Purvis; and his cousin Justin Scott.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Survivors include his parents Jessica and Eric Jaramillo of Suffolk, Va.; his siblings Mason Graves and Natalie Graves, both of Laurel, and Cynthia Graves, Jody Graves, Adam Jaramillo and Isabella Jaramillo, all of Suffolk; his grandparents June Purvis of Laurel and Jose and Julie Jaramillo of Houston, Texas, and Susan and Scott Holbert of Silsbee, Texas; a special friend, Joanna Pickering of Hattiesburg; and a host of aunts, uncles, cousins and friends.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pallbearers will be Kalob Redmond, Robin Powell Jr., Ed Poore, Joey Coker, Bill Freeman and Joe Caley.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The family requests that in lieu of flowers, memorials be made to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation or the Diamonds in the Rough Horse Rescue, 19251 Bob White Road, Windsor, VA 23487</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Online guestbook may be signed at <a href=#>www.ellisvillefuneralhome.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnmqSyrXnSnKatrF2cv6LCxKxmmqqknrCtsb5ya2yZZJh9pnnAb2tvZWFmsnl5mG6cbWVll7J1hJZwmGxrYJl7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./extra-billowy-dutch-baby-pancake.html><span>←</span><span>extra-billowy dutch babypancake</span></a>
