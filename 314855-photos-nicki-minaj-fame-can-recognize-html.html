However, with time, searches about her photos before fame seem to dominate. For that reason, here is a collection of her photos before she gained global fame.</p><h2>1. The true definition of glow up</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a67027119508023f.png><p class=align-left>Nicki is definitely one of the stunning beauties in the globe today. Her glow is highly admired by most people in the world. However, most people never take time to ask themselves where this glowing queen was before fame. Before rising to stardom, Onika Tanya Maraj was almost losing hope. She endured a lot of hardships on her way to success. Onika had tried multiple times to build the foundation of her music career by working different jobs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dde704949c6471ff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Netizens Impressed by Nikita Kering's Ugali Cooking Skills: "Back to the Roots"</span></p></a><h2>2. Barbie the mother of fashion and tattoos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dde704949c6471ff.jpg><p class=align-left>Nicki Minaj has turned multiple heads with her iconic fashion sense. Her attire is quite unique, making her an admirable fashion queen. Even though her sense of fashion has significantly changed with time, she did not look that bad before she became famous, right? Also, her Chinese tattoo is still intact and looking amazing.</p><h2>3. There's more to the star that what meets the eye</h2><p class=align-left>Did you know that Nicki Minaj real name is Tanya Maraj? Well, better known as Nicki Minaj, Tanya started her music career in a <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">rap group</a> known as <i>Hoodstars</i>. <i>Hoodstars</i> consisted of three other members who were Lou$tar, Scagg Beezy and 7even Up. During this period, she was signed to the <i>Dirty Money Record</i> label. Still, under this label, Tanya went ahead and released two more mixtapes known as <i>Sucka Free </i>and <i>Beam Me Up Scotty</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/522e520119204eec.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nadia Mukami: 10 cutest photos of the Kenyan singer-songwriter</span></p></a><h2>4. Always a unique hairstyle for the queen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d1e46d1fe68a6969.png><p class=align-left>Nicki's wigs have been a subject of discussion for an extended period now. They are quite exceptional and head-turning. Before her fame, however, she used to show off more of her natural hair. When you take a look at some of the revealed Nicki Minaj before fame images, you will see her in more natural and everyday hairstyles. Hardly will you see her rocking the multi-colored wigs. Even when the <i>Young Money Entertainment</i> label approached her, Tanya was still rocking her natural looks. Despite this fact, one thing we can all agree on is that she is gorgeous in those wigs.</p><h2>5. The secret to Nicki's charming physique</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/522e520119204eec.jpg><p class=align-left>Another thing that you will notice when you look at Nicki Minaj photos before fame is the fact that her physique has changed drastically. The gorgeous American rapper and songwriter is not a newcomer when it comes to the subject of celebs who have had plastic surgery. Among the plastic surgery rumours of Nicki Minaj, the most popular one is that of her butt implants.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5fba3e432f2be68d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shanna Mendiola: 7 facts about the NBC Los Angeles weather girl</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When the subject of being under the knife is brought up, she seems to be somehow reluctant to address whether or not she has been under the knife. However, she pointed out that only her underground followers would know how she used to look like. In case you never knew Nicki Minaj before fame, take a look at the picture and notice the changes.</p><p class=align-left>Over time, Nicki Minaj has developed so much as an artist and also grown so much as an actress. She has such a thriving career, and many would not believe that she used to struggle back in the day. Similarly, one cannot believe that their beloved rapper and songwriter used to rock natural hair back in the day. All these aspects have made people search even more for Nicki Minaj before fame photos.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Amanda Holden husband, children, salary, net worth</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkG1vbm1dpbWwwM6sZKehk6C2brnIp5ijZZaWuqZ5wpqlZqqVmLyousiznGegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./morrison-man-arrested-on-child-pornography-charges.html><span>←</span><span>Morrison man arrested on child pornography charges</span></a>
