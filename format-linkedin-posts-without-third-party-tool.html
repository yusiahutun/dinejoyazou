How, then, can you get your LinkedIn audience to engage your post?</p><p>One way to improve readability is by proper formatting. However, with LinkedIn’s plain text structure, users can’t access custom formatting features like bolding, italics, and underlining.</p><p>Although there are text converter tools to explore, they have their drawbacks. But here are some tips for formatting your LinkedIn posts without using a third-party tool.</p><h2 id=use-white-spacing-in-posts>1. Use White Spacing in Posts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-linkedin-post-showing-white-spacing-between-h2s.jpg><p>As a LinkedIn user, you may have seen other creators with double spacing in their posts. These are white spaces, and they are an important tool you can use when formatting your post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spacing plays a huge role in readability. You can use double spacing in your post to break your content into easily-digestible bits, which improves readability and gives your work a professional look. It also emphasizes key points in your post as the readers’ eyes are drawn to blocks of text in your post.</p><p>The proper way to use white spacing is in between paragraphs, sections, before and after bullet points, and other similar areas.</p><h2 id=use-hashtags-for-your-headers>2. Use Hashtags for Your Headers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-linkedin-post-showing-hashtag-use-in-headers.jpg><p>Many active LinkedIn users already <a href=#>use hashtags to get more engagement on LinkedIn</a>. Adding relatable tags at the end of your article helps increase your post's reach. But hashtags can be used to highlight important parts of your write-up. For example, you can hashtag a product/service, your headers, or popular quotes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why? LinkedIn hashtags are blue, and that makes them stand out in a post. So, your hashtags can have a dual purpose. The first and actual purpose will be to increase post visibility and reach. The second is to help readers identify distinct sections in a post due to the blue text sprinkled across the article.</p><h2 id=add-an-emoji-for-lists-or-headers>3. Add an Emoji for Lists or Headers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-linkedin-post-showing-bullet-points-in-front-of-headers.jpg><p>Emojis are your friends on LinkedIn too. While there’s a misconception that emojis aren’t ideal for such a professional platform, they can be an effective tool to customize your posts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Imagine you have a few bullet points to add to your article. Numbering or lettering them may not be as visible as you want since you can make them bold. But, using an appropriate emoji will definitely draw your audience’s eyes to that section of your post—and they can easily decipher that it’s a bullet point section.</p><p>As an extra tip, you should stick with one or two emojis to stay consistent. This can help you <a href=#>build a personal brand identity on LinkedIn</a> since users can attribute the post style to you.</p><h2 id=use-varied-capitalization>4. Use Varied Capitalization</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-linkedin-post-showing-headers-in-uppercase.jpg><p>Writing in uppercase is our final tip to give you a well-formatted work. But use all caps sparingly.</p><p>For instance, when readers see a section in uppercase, it draws their attention to see what the section is about. Applying this principle, you can use it to make your headers stand out. You can also write important quotes, phrases, and concepts in uppercase, which makes them stand out to the reader.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=make-your-linkedin-posts-more-appealing-to-read>Make Your LinkedIn Posts More Appealing to Read</h2><p>You can use these tips to format your LinkedIn posts in a unique way. But make sure to use each tip in moderation so that your posts don't seem spammy or chaotic.</p><p>After all, is said and done, the end goal is to create visually appealing and readable content on LinkedIn. We hope you find these tips valuable for your next LinkedIn post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGidqKqdlsFuuMinop6cmaN6sbvSrapmr5mptbDB02aroaGimXqxrdGtsGasn6S5cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-morey.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Morey</span></a>
