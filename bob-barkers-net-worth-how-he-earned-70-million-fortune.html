<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Bob Barker's Net Worth: How He Earned $70 Million Fortune</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>In his 35 years as the host of </span><a href=#><i><span>The Price is Right</span></i></a><span>, millions of viewers tuned in to see </span><a href=#>Bob Barker</a><span> lead the program with his charm. Prior to his <a href=#>August 2023 death</a>, the animal lover had a whopping net worth thanks to his record-breaking career on television.</span></p><h2>What Was Bob Barker’s Net Worth?</h2><p><span>Bob had an estimated net worth of $70 million, according to </span><a href=#><span>Celebrity Net Worth</span></a><span>. The Hollywood icon retired from the </span><a href=#><span>daytime game show</span></a><span> in 2007. He had initially begun his career in television just as the medium was getting big, being named the host of </span><i><span>Truth or Consequences</span></i><span> in 1956. Game show producer Ralph Edwards saw the then-radio host in action while doing an audience participation segment.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shutterstock_editorial_1510020a.jpg><p><span>Bob was a complete </span><a href=#><span>natural in the game show format</span></a><span> and was with </span><i><span>Truth or Consequences</span></i><span> until 1975. While he was still on the show, CBS wanted to revive </span><i><span>The Price is Right</span></i><span>, but only if Bob was the host. They got their wish, and his first episode of the iconic series aired on September 4, 1972.</span></p><p><span>Over the next 35 years, Bob was </span><a href=#><span>well compensated for his hosting duties</span></a><span> and keeping the show so popular across generations of viewers. But it was during the last decade of his tenure when he made serious bank! Bob was paid an estimated $10 million a year during that period. That adds up to $100 million over 10 years’ time!</span></p><h2>What Causes Did Bob Barker Support With His Earnings?</h2><p><span>Animal rights was an issue close to Bob’s heart, and he signed off every episode of </span><i><span>The Price Is Right</span></i><span> for years with the phrase, “Help control the pet population. Have your pets spayed or neutered.” He put his money where his mouth is, with several major donations to animal rights groups.</span></p><p><span>Bob gave $5 million in 2010 to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The animal activist group used the money to purchase a ship which they named the “MY Bob Barker.” It is used to find and interrupt Japanese whaling vessels. Bob later purchased a helicopter for the organization.</span></p><p><span>The beloved game show host’s name also sits atop PETA’s Los Angeles headquarters. Bob donated $2.5 million to the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to construct the building that now bears his moniker.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In another act of helping out animals, he paid $700,000 in 2014 for three elephants to be relocated from a zoo in Toronto, Canada, to a sanctuary in California. He also gave Georgetown University’s law school a $1 million endowment for an animal rights study program.</span></p><h2>Was Bob Barker Married?</h2><p><span>On top of the incredible fortune Bob built from hosting, he found love with <a href=#>Dorothy Jo Gideon</a>. He was married to his late wife for 36 years before her death in 1981 at the age of 67. The Washington native found love again with his girlfriend, </span><b>Nancy Burnet</b><span>. The pair met at an animal adoption event in 1983 and had a shared love for animal activism.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I think his legacy is just the lives — the millions of the animals that have not been born — because of his show,” Nancy told </span><a href=#><i><span>Closer</span></i></a><span> about her beau in August 2022. “Helping to raise awareness about spaying and neutering, which is probably the most important thing … He made the awareness and made people think about it.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bpptlkpa%2FrLHRrGSnnaRixLC%2B06FkoaenYrWmecSaqaedlGKEcXnMoqOloZ%2Bjeqe70a2sp51f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-lachey-and-holly-letchworth.html><span>←</span><span>Nick Lachey and Holly Letchworth</span></a>
