He was so funny. Love you brother rip, please keep me and his family in your PRAYERS. TELL SOMEONE YOU LOVE THEM TODAY AND MEAN IT, LIFE JUST TOO SHORT TO BE HOLDING GRUDGES. I LOVE YOU ALL.”</p><p>It is reported that in addition to being a member of the group, he was also their road manager.</p><p>The rapper ended up being in a bitter feud with his ex Lasancious after the song went gold.
