I really don’t. When I had the freedom to do this more often, I always felt awkward and fidgety and now that I’m old enough to not care, we only occasionally have the luxury of going out without two <a href=#>small</a> people and snack cups of Cheerios, and certainly not alone, you know, sitting at a bar, reading a book like one of those grownups you always thought you’d be? But this time I did. The salad was perfect. The bread was warm. The bartender talked me into (I’m sure I was terribly hard to convince) a glass of wine and 35 minutes later I resumed my errands happy and fed and cared for and swore I’d do this more often, although I really don’t.</p><p><a title=mixing href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/1/565/30691141504_0c66d1c6d8_z.jpg alt=mixing width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="yes, please" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c3.staticflickr.com/1/128/31160711090_61d1108398_z.jpg alt="yes, please" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="cooling nuts + visitor" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c5.staticflickr.com/1/72/30691141284_eeea6d787d_z.jpg alt="cooling nuts + visitor" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I’ve been thinking about this because The Union Square Cafe reopens this week and although it’s been twenty-six years since its <a href=#>cookbook</a> came out, the bar nuts recipe inside is as easy to make and addictive as ever. It seems hard to imagine that such simple ingredients — a pat of butter, brown sugar, salt, cayenne and minced rosemary — could transform even the unloved Brazil nut into something you cannot stop snacking on, but that’s really what a timeless recipe does. I hope it becomes your new holiday habit, too.</p><p><a title="union square cafe's bar nuts" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c5.staticflickr.com/1/5/31160710660_46f9db4697_z.jpg alt="union square cafe's bar nuts" width=640 height=426 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h5>Previously</h5><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Potato Kugel</a> and <a href=#>Pull Apart Rugelach</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Twice-Baked Potatoes with Kale</a> and <a href=#>Decadent Hot Chocolate Mix</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Cigarettes Russes</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Cauliflower Feta Fritters with Pomegranate</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Nutmeg-Maple Butter Cookies</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>Roasted Chestnut Cookies</a><br><b>Seven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Balsmic-Braised Brussels Sprouts with Pancetta</a> and <a href=#>Cream Biscuits</a><br><b>Eight years ago:</b> <a href=#>Cauliflower Gratin</a>, <a href=#>All-Butter, Really Flaky Pie Dough</a> and <a href=#>Pumpkin Cupcakes</a><br><b>Nine years ago:</b> <a href=#>Rugelach Pinwheels</a>, <a href=#>Fennel Ice Cream</a> and <a href=#>Ratatouille Tart</a><br><b>Ten! years ago:</b> <a href=#>My Favorite Banana Bread</a> and <a href=#>Homemade Orangettes</a></p><p><i>And for the other side of the world:</i><br><b>Six Months Ago:</b> <a href=#>Chicken Gyro Salad</a> and <a href=#>The Consummate Chocolate Chip Cookie, Revisited</a><br><b>1.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Picnic Pink Lemonade</a> and <a href=#>Crispy Frizzled Artichokes</a></p><p><b>2.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Nancy’s Chopped Salad</a> and <a href=#>Coconut Brown Butter Cookies</a><br><b>3.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Rhubarb Cream Cheese Hand Pies</a><br><b>4.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Rhubarb Snacking Cake</a> and <a href=#>Asparagus with Almonds and Yogurt Dressing</a></p><p style="border-bottom:1px dashed #6b7794"></p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>Union Square Cafe's Bar Nuts</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>Makes 3 2/3 cups</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-time><strong>Time:</strong> <span class=time>30 minutes</span></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-source><strong>Source: </strong><a href=#>The Union Square Cafe Cookbook</a></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul><br>A few things worth mentioning:<p>The original recipe, which can be found verbatim from one end of the internet to the other, calls for 18 ounces or 2 1/4 cups of assorted unsalted nuts, which would be just fine if 2 1/4 cups of nuts didn’t weigh about 11 ounces, no matter what nut you use. This led me to make this twice, first with 2 1/4 cups nuts — it was a tad too salty and spicy, even with halved volume cayenne — and then with 18 ounces (which is more like 3 2/3 cups of nuts), in which the seasoning was more spot-on. No surprise really that restaurants cook using weights, not cups. I then made it a third time, this time with some nuts pretzel nuggets (I used <a href=#>this brand</a>) and it was excellent. Hi, would you like to come over for some spiced nuts? We have buckets!</p><p>I make another change from the original, which is I bake the nuts further after tossing them in the spiced butter, which helps it set. You’re supposed to serve them warm (and they rewarm well) but they’re also just as addictive at room temperature.</p><p>Finally, but it’s a big finally, the flavor here hinges on both salt and cayenne, which is great because: yum but terrible for recipe writing because 1 teaspoon of salt varies <i>wildly</i> by saltiness depending on type and brand (even among Kosher salts, some weigh more than twice as much as others) and I find that some cayennes are much hotter than others. What should you do? Well, I use Diamond brand kosher salt, the lightest weight of them. For any other brand of kosher salt, you should start with half and use more to taste. For a coarse sea salt, you’re safe using the full teaspoon and possibly even more. For a flaky featherweight Maldon sea salt, you could probably safely use 2 teaspoons, as Nigella does. If your cayenne packs a lot of heat, as mine does, I found that half (1/4 teaspoon level) gave the nuts a nice kicky but not overpowering heat. If you carry hot sauce in your purse, you should use the whole amount.</p><p>I know that a lot of people think that they don’t like rosemary but I am willing to wager a bet that at least 2/3 of rosemary-averse people will still like it here. Everyone does, really.</p><br><ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>18 ounces (3 2/3 cups) assorted unsalted nuts or 2 1/3 cups mixed nuts and 1 1/3 cups pretzel nuggets</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, coarsely chopped</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne (see note up top)</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 teaspoons dark brown sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 teaspoon kosher salt (see note up top)</li></ul><br>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread nuts (if using pretzels, don’t add them yet) on a tray and toast for 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly golden and fragrant. While they’re toasting, whisk butter, rosemary, cayenne, sugar and salt in the bottom of a large bowl. When nuts are toasted, add them to bowl and stir to evenly coat. Add pretzels, if using, and coat again. Spread back on tray and toast for another 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool slightly, then serve warm in bowls. Nuts are also good at room temperature, and keep for weeks in airtight jars.<br><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-30475 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-30475 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
