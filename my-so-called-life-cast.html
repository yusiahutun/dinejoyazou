The show centered on high schooler Angela Chase (played by Claire Danes in one of her earliest roles) and the many highs and lows she faced navigating the tricky terrain of being a teen.</p><p>On air from 1994 to 1995, My So-Called Life perfectly captured Gen X teen life, with its grunge-inspired fashions and spot-on soundtrack. The show was also memorably bold in its nuanced handling of heavy themes like sex, drug and alcohol use, class dynamics and much more.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>The drama never shied away from showing the more challenging parts of the high school experience, which gave it a poignant resonance with teen viewers who felt like outsiders.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/my-so-called-life_uDjmRw-edited.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>My So-Called Life cast</h2><p>My So-Called Life unfolded from the relatable point of view of Angela (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Claire Danes</a>), who narrated the show. The cast of characters also included Angela’s crush, Jordan (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jared Leto</a>); her cool new bad girlfriend, Rayanne (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A.J. Langer</a>); her good girl former BFF, Sharon (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Devon Odessa</a>); her charming gay friend, Rickie (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wilson Cruz</a>); her nerdy, lovestruck classmate, Brian (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Devon Gummersall</a>); her mom, Patty (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bess Armstrong</a>); her dad, Graham (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Irwin</a>); and her little sister, Danielle (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Wilhoit</a>).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/my-so-called-life_DNSUYi-edited.jpg><p>Danes was just 14 when she was cast in her breakout role. “That was wild because I was the same age as the character, and there was an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible symmetry</a> between us,”&nbsp;Danes told Interview Magazine in 2013.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alicia Silverstone</a>, was also up for the role, but lost out after being deemed “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">too beautiful</a>” and therefore not relatable enough to play Angela by co-executive producer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marshall Herskovitz</a>.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>“As If!” 12 of the Best Alicia Silverstone Movies, Ranked</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/my-so-called-life_b3aaeea5-edited.jpg><p>Today, 30 years later, the My So-Called Life cast has nothing but fond memories of the show. “Even though we were all devastated when it ended, I do think we are grateful for it being such a short-lived and kind of perfect thing that happened under glass, in a way,” Gummersall (who played Brian) told Elle in 2016. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It was over before it became huge</a>, so it had a purity to it that was unique and rare.”</p><p>In 2018, Danes told Entertainment Tonight, “I think it was maybe just a little <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">too ahead of its time</a>.”</p><p>We still miss My So-Called Life, and since its cancellation it’s become a major comfort watch for both viewers who were fans the first time around and younger folks who discovered it long after it ended. Here’s a look at the My So-Called Life cast then and now.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Claire Danes as Angela Chase</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/1_ed2bb7.png><p>After her time as the star of the My So-Called Life cast, Claire Danes went on to play Juliet in the 1996 adaptation Romeo + Juliet. Her other roles in the ’90s included U Turn (1997), The Mod Squad (1999) and Brokedown Palace (1999).</p><p>In the ’00s, Danes further established herself as a mature actress with roles in Igby Goes Down (2002), The Hours (2002) and Shopgirl (2005). She also went back to her TV roots, playing the titular autistic scientist in the TV movie Temple Grandin (2010) and starring as CIA agent Carrie Mathison in the acclaimed drama Homeland from 2011 to 2020. She won Emmy awards for both roles.</p><p>Most recently, Danes starred in three different miniseries, The Essex Serpent (2022), Fleishman Is in Trouble (2022) and Full Circle (2023).</p><p>Offscreen, Danes, now 44, is married to fellow actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugh Dancy</a>, who she met during production of the 2007 film Evening.

After the show ended, he appeared in popular films like The Thin Red Line (1998); Fight Club (1999); Girl, Interrupted (1999); Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Panic Room (2002).</p><p>Leto’s role as a transgender woman suffering from AIDS in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club earned him an Oscar, and since then he’s appeared in movies like Suicide Squad (2016), Blade Runner 2049 (2017), House of Gucci (2021) and Morbius (2022). Most recently, he starred in the 2022 miniseries WeCrashed and appeared in the 2023 movie Haunted Mansion.</p><p>Now 52, Leto is well-known for his eccentric personality and commitment to method acting. Outside of his film and TV work, he’s also been in an alternative rock band, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thirty Seconds to Mars</a>, since 1998.</p><p>While Leto has gone on to be an acclaimed actor, the impact of his early role in My So-Called Life remains.

Her charmed life ended in 2023 when they announced their split. They have two children, and lived near the British city of Exeter, where they resided at Powderham Castle.</p><p>Becoming the Countess of Devon was an adjustment, and was very different from the bohemian role Langer played in My So-Called Life.
