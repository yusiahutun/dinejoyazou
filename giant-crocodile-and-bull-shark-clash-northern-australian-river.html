We thought it was a barramundi [fish] or something. The guide took the boat in for a closer look and lo' and behold, it was a shark."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brutus, who is thought to be about 80 years old and is missing a front leg and most of his teeth, is well known in the area. Speculation is that the prospect of a fish dinner was tasty revenge for the crocodile, who was thought to have lost his limb to one of the sharks who inhabit nearby waters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The said Brutus won the struggle with the much smaller shark, but Paice said he wasn't so sure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"When we went past the first time the croc was lying there with the shark in its mouth," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"When we pulled the boat in closer it slid back into the water. And when the shark, or the mouth of the croc, hit the water, the shark started to thrash around."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"So it was certainly still alive. We couldn't see any blood anywhere," he said, noting that Brutus had few teeth left. "It may have got away. It may have got eaten, we don't know."</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Sharks is these waters?
