Arguably, their greatest innovation towards this end is 1-Click Ordering.&nbsp;The company has probably tried to push it on you already, but it's worth knowing what it is and how it works before you do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At a basic level, Amazon's 1-Click Ordering is a simple way to set a default payment method and address for your orders. After&nbsp;choosing which credit card and address you want to&nbsp;use, you can click a single button, then sit back and wait for your stuff to show up at your door.</p><p>Amazon also automatically consolidates your orders based on their availability. Say you use 1-Click Ordering to purchase three items at once. Rather than charge you&nbsp;for shipping three times, Amazon will&nbsp;take a look at where your items are shipping from, how long they'll take to ship, and if they can be grouped together. The company will consolidate <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">as many items together as possible</a>&nbsp;to reduce shipping costs.</p><p>However, Amazon's 1-Click Ordering&nbsp;can get a little tricky. There are a few different types of 1-Click Ordering and turning one on or off may not affect any of the others:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Regular 1-Click Ordering:</strong> These settings apply&nbsp;to orders placed on Amazon's website. They may also be used&nbsp;for orders placed through devices like the Amazon Echo.</li><li><strong>Mobile 1-Click Ordering:</strong> Slightly confusingly, this is a separate feature for normal 1-Click Ordering. You can use the same&nbsp;credit card and address, but if you turn off Mobile 1-Click Ordering, it won't affect your regular 1-Click settings, and vice versa.</li><li><strong>Digital 1-Click Ordering:</strong>&nbsp;All digital purchases---such as ebooks, downloadable music, and digital game codes---are ordered using Digital 1-Click settings. This method uses a default&nbsp;payment method, but obviously there's no need for a default address since there's nothing to ship. You cannot turn off Digital 1-Click Ordering.</li></ul><p>To set up your 1-Click settings (if you haven't already), <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">go to this Amazon page</a>&nbsp;to enter a default address and payment method. Amazon will use that information from now on when you select "Buy now with 1-Click."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you've placed any&nbsp;1-Click order (aside from digital content) you have <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">around 30 minutes</a> to change your order before&nbsp;it's placed. Amazon then checks which items it can group together, calculates shipping costs, and then sends your order out for delivery.&nbsp;Depending on how quickly some items ship (and whether&nbsp;you have Amazon Prime), your stuff could be shipped out within hours.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Secure Your Amazon Account</a></span></p><p>While this is convenient, there are&nbsp;some downsides. The&nbsp;most obvious problem with 1-Click Ordering is security.&nbsp;If you have 1-Click enabled on your phone and you lose it or it ends up in the hands of a child, there's nothing to stop them&nbsp;from <a href=#>ordering stuff with your phone</a>. You might even place an accidental order yourself when you're not paying attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some orders can also go through a little too quickly to change your mind.&nbsp;Say a child takes your phone and orders an item that qualifies for free one-day (or same-day) shipping.&nbsp;If you don't spot it immediately, the order could ship before you have a chance to cancel it. After it ships,&nbsp;you're not dealing with a cancellation---you're dealing with a return. <a href=#>It's happened before</a> and while it's not a nightmare, it's certainly an inconvenience.</p><p>One of the most practical reasons you might want to skip 1-Click Ordering, however, is potentially increased shipping times. Amazon will wait up to three days to ship an item if it can be&nbsp;bundled with something else to save on shipping costs. Say, for example, you order items A, B, and C on Monday. Item A could ship immediately and could get to your house by Tuesday, while Items B and C won't be able to ship until Wednesday. Amazon might (depending on where your items are shipping from) decide to hold off on sending you Item A until it can go out with Items B and C, meaning it could take extra days to get some of your stuff. If you place your order using the shopping cart manually,&nbsp;you get more control over when and how your items ship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, for many people, 1-Click is convenient enough to be worth the trade offs. If you order from Amazon frequently and dislike&nbsp;confirming the same information every single time, 1-Click Ordering can save you a lot of hassle. Though it might cost you&nbsp;more money in the long run if you have less time to reconsider that 2:00 AM shopping spree.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhqa2hjboFww8eaq2aho2J%2Bbq%2FLopqkZZ%2Bnsaa%2ByKeeZqeeYq6urdmopWaZnpl6qbvWZpuonaNitrV51qippGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cod-warzone-2.html><span>←</span><span>Robin Hood | DMZ Missions Guide in Warzone</span></a>
