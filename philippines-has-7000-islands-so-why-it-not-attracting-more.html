That is bound to change as more ports are built and officials look at cruise tourism as a key source of arrivals.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the economy in danger of notching its slowest expansion since 2011, tourism is emerging as a key focus of efforts to boost growth. Tourism accounted for 12.7 per cent of the Philippines’ gross domestic product last year, already beating the government’s goal of 10 per cent by 2022. Government officials are revising up the targets in the country’s tourism development plan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is great potential in cruise tourism,” said Tourism Undersecretary Benito Bengzon. “While our Asian neighbours have the advantage of a regional land connectivity, our archipelago is ideal for cruise tourism.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/09/4d3fc62a-e98f-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_1320x770_114046.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Philippines’ cruise strategy focuses on Manila, Boracay and Puerto Princesa, as well as potential new destinations in the northern part of Luzon, the country’s main island. Salomague Port in Ilocos Sur province, expected to open this month, will receive Royal Caribbean Cruises’ biggest ship in Asia in December. The “Spectrum of the Seas” will return again in January and February.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In April 2021, Manila’s first cruise-dedicated port is expected to open at the Solaire Cruise Centre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“These cruise ports will allow more access to the Philippines and encourage more shorter itineraries from north Asian markets like China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Japan,” Bengzon said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cruise tourism brings large numbers of people to concentrated areas for brief periods, multiplying and focusing the economic impact. At a recent trade show, government officials and representatives of major cruise lines discussed the possibility of adding the Philippines to Asian itineraries from 2020.</p>The private sector is on board for the infrastructure push.<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"></span></a><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Where are Chinese tourists going if they’re giving Hong Kong a miss?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Cruise calls in Manila, and the Philippines in general, have been growing quite strongly,” said Enrique Razon, chairman of casino-resort operator Bloomberry Resorts. “Aside from Manila, we’re looking for one cruise-ship facility in the north and possibly two in the south.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tourism has been growing steadily in the Philippines in recent years, reaching 7.2 million visitors last year and 4.85 million in the first seven months of 2019. The government’s target is about 8.2 million visitors for 2019 and 12 million by the end of 2022, but that pales next to Thailand, which expects more than 40 million tourists this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/09/096edfe4-e98f-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_1320x770_114046.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Employment in tourism and related industries has been rising faster than overall job growth. Tourism accounted for 13.4 per cent of Philippine jobs in 2018, projected to rise to 14.4 per cent by 2022, according to the Department of Tourism.</p>Central bank Governor Benjamin Diokno said the amount of foreign currency from tourism should rise now that Boracay island, which was closed for six months last year for environmental rehabilitation, has reopened to tourists.<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"></span></a><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Duterte’s South China Sea U-turn: climbdown, or a gambit for oil?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While cruise arrivals can spur development of new tourist spots, they have more environmental impact than land-based tourism, said Robert Dan Roces, chief economist at Security Bank in Manila. Sometimes dubbed “floating cities”, cruise ships have a relatively large carbon footprint, dump fuel into the ocean and leave a lot of waste at their destinations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat is urging more support for sustainable tourism to spread benefits throughout the country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After all, tourism is everybody’s business,” she said.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Manila eyes bigger share of cruise tourism industry</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miYrKGRZMCwwdOhnJqrpGKutLXAaJirrJmYuaZ7kmlqanFpZ3yxtMiloKmomaOytHnHmqpmb2BlfW610qWYp5yjYsCwedahsGahpGK7sMCMmqutqpGYwaq6xmakqKqV</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./makeup-by-mario-lip-serum-sephora-6742681.html><span>←</span><span>Reviews Say the Makeup By Mario Lip Serum Is Plumping</span></a>
