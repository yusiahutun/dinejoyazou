The Prince of Wales has taken a more serious role as a senior royal for years now. However, there was a time when he was the family’s most charming member who dazzled fans in every public appearance.</strong></p><p>Long before he became the Duke of Cambridge and the Prince of Wales, <a href=#>Prince William</a> was the royal family’s rockstar. Years before the prince began sneaking Kate <a href=#>off on secret dates</a>, he had a massive female fan following. This <a href=#>Prince William ‘mania’</a> was perfectly depicted in Netflix’s The Crown’s final episodes. The episode Willsmania shows just how much the ladies loved <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s firstborn in his teenage years and his 20s. A video on <a href=#>TikTok</a> also captures Willsmania of the 90s and 2000s. Its comments section is filled with the ladies still showing a lot of love to the future King of England.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-52106761-660x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-viral-video-shows-prince-william-s-popularity-in-his-younger-days>Viral video shows Prince William’s popularity in his younger days</h2><p>A video shared by the page, Lovely Catherine, shows a teen William greeting a sea of excited women as they hand him a bouquet and more gifts. It also focuses on the Prince of Wales’ stunningly sharp looks as he greatly resembles the late Princess Diana.</p><p>At one point he is also seen holding a baby in his hands during a church service. The Prince’s popularity grew meteorically in the wake of his mother’s death in 1997. The ‘Willsmania’ continued until his marriage to <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> in 2010.</p><p>Not only was he was heartthrob on his home turf in the UK but across the world in places like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and more places.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-think-william-resembled-a-disney-prince>Fans think William resembled a Disney Prince</h2><p>Under the viral TikTok, several fans have commented sharing their thoughts on the younger Prince William.</p><p>One fan called his younger version a “Disney Prince.” A second fan expressed how in her younger days William was her “fairytale dream guy.”</p><p>A third fan also called the royal “Princess Diana’s twin.”</p><p>A fourth fan said, “He still looks super handsome today. Can’t wait to see what their (Kate and William) children will look like in the future.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-william-s-romances-before-kate-came-along>William’s romances before Kate came along</h2><p>His dashing looks, royal status, charming personality, and massive fan following meant William had no shortage of beautiful girls who wanted to date him.</p><p>The Prince reportedly dated a wealthy girl named Jecca Craig in 1998. They broke up in 1999 but remained friends. He even traveled to her family’s wildlife conservancy near Mount Kenya in 2001.&nbsp;The two went separate ways before William entered St Andrew’s where met his future wife Kate.</p><p>The Daily Mail <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">notes</a>, that the Prince laid his eyes on Davina Duckworth-Chad in the summer of 1999 when he boarded a yacht filled with beauties and sailed to the Aegean Sea. Davina’s family was closely connected to the crown.</p><p>Not much is known about the Prince’s relationship with Rose Farquhar but it is said that she was his “first love.”</p><p>However, the Prince found both his wife and his future queen in none other than his St Andrews classmate Kate.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eCcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZp6Ro8Bus9Ssn2anppq%2FbsDHnmSyp6WjtG6%2BzrKYpWWnnbxuw8CsZJpllKeyornYZpuiq56axm680aKlnJ1dmLWivsyipaBn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-eleanor-rigby-by-the-beatles.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of Eleanor Rigby by The Beatles</span></a>
