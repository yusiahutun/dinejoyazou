Berry supports his understated, rough-and-ready vocal performance with high harmonies in the chorus, and a screaming guitar solo highlights the rock-influenced track.</p><p>The lyric is a twist on a classic country song, with the narrator asking whiskey for mercy&nbsp;— not for himself, but for a former love who is still hurting from their split.</p><p>"While she's trying to forget / Don't let her do something she'll regret / You're not her type / I know she's just hurt / Hey whiskey, take it easy on her," Berry sings in the chorus.</p><p>"Sometimes breaking up doesn't mean falling out of love," Berry&nbsp;says. "This song is about a girl going out on one of those newly-single-drown-your-sorrows kind of nights. It's from the perspective of a guy that's struggling with the reality that what she does or doesn't do isn't his concern anymore, but he can't help but still care."</p><p>"I'm proud to be sharing this song as my debut single and the fact that I wrote it with two of my best friends, Tom Whall and Zarni DeWet, makes it even more fun. I hope y'all love it," he concludes.</p><p>Berry is a veteran of the trio Mockingbird Sun, and he had ten years of extensive touring under his belt when the group came to an end in 2016. The Texas native opted to remain in Nashville, where he's been working over the past few years to develop new skills as a producer. He put those skills to use in self-producing "Whiskey Take It Easy," which is available beginning Friday (Jan. 22) via <a href=#>Spotify</a>, <a href=#>Apple Music</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>iTunes</a>.</p><p>For more information about Charlie Berry, visit his <a href=#>official website</a>, or keep up with him via <a href=#>Facebook</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p><strong>Please&nbsp;Enjoy&nbsp;Country's 100 Best Drinking Songs Responsibly:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnKCRp7mqsYybnKuqqWLEqbXSpJyyZaSWuKZ5yK1knpmjrnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jasmine-skin-care.html><span>←</span><span>Why Jasmine Is the Must-Try Skin Care Ingredient for Winter</span></a>
