Secrets can be a powerful political weapon to wield, especially on the brink of a civil war. No one knows this better than the White Worm.
Episode 9 of House of the Dragon puts the elusive White Worm front and center as the beginning of the Dance of the Dragons (the name for the imminent Targaryen civil war) foments.
