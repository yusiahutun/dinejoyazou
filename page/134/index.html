He warned that the public should be on guard against attempts by pro-independence politicians to seek independence through changes to the island's constitution.
The celebrations, which sought to play up the island's historical connection to the mainland, were the first time that Beijing had officially marked 'Taiwan Retrocession Day', when the island was handed over to Chinese rule by Japan after its defeat in 1945.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Was Shawna Farina Cause Of Death?
