Cowboy boots have been the sisters’ first choice since they learned to walk. At the same time, they recognize that some shoppers associate cowboy boots with specific, country-leaning contexts; they even put aside their own pairs while working in luxury fashion (Lemkin) and celebrity styling (Sample). “When we left the South and moved to the big cities—Los Angeles and New York City—we partially retired our boots, finding it hard to find the perfect [pairs] that could keep up with both our busy lives and fit our respective styles,” Sample says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Years later, amid a larger cowboy boot resurgence, Sample and Lemkin are poised to infiltrate street style with their take on the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g40746010/best-leather-boots-women/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="best leather boots" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">best leather boots</a>. Partlow opens today with six elevated reinterpretations of cowboy boots. The vibe is “European luxury meets American utility”: Made in Italy, each pair features supple leather, a walkable, two-inch heel, and four layers of supportive cushioning. The design process began with the scaled-back, brown leather Julia boot. More adventurous variations like the Abigail, Rochelle, and Whitney include contrast stitching and geometric cutouts.</p><img alt="a model wears a pair of brown cowboy boots from partlo in a news story about the first partlow boots" title="Partlow Cowboy Boots" width=1422 height=1777 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/julia-boot-64e4b4b103bb2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">David Roemer/Partlow</span><p>A model wearing the Julia boot, Partlow’s first design. “We worked on the concept of the boot for years; when we went to Italy, we were very hands-on perfecting the design,” Lemkin says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Partlow is named for the founders’ paternal grandmother and muse: Gigi (Aleene) Partlow. While she didn’t wear boots herself, her larger-than-life personality and elevated individual style influenced the line’s mix of select materials and Southern charm. (“Everyone in the family laughs and says she didn’t wear them because she was trying to get off the farm and onto Fifth Avenue!” Sample says.)<br></p><img alt="a model wears the rochelle boots from partlow with a glittery jumpsuit in front of a window" title="Partlow Cowboy Boots" width=1000 height=1250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/partlow-boots-rochelle-boot-64e4b6632d5c6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">David Roemer/Partlow</span></p><img alt="a model stands in front of a window wearing a ruffled dress and partlow boots" title="Partlow Cowboy Boots" width=1000 height=1250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/partlow-boots-jordana-boot-64e4b75962130.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">David Roemer/Partlow</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was very important to us that the Partlow boot looked like a traditional western boot, but felt elevated and suitable for all environments and occasions,” Lemkin says. “I want to wear cowboy boots because they are not only chic but comfortable!” She and Sample went after this idea by giving their boots more rounded toes—a signature of riding boots that could “elevate the overall look”—and using materials that read more runway than rodeo.</p><img alt="a model wears a faux fur coat and cowboy boots from partlow" title="Partlow Cowboy Boots" width=1000 height=1250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/partlow-boots-christina-boot-64e4b796d9a0a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">David Roemer/Partlow</span><p>“Some of my favorite ways I have seen western boots worn are when they are paired with everyday looks, like a mid-calf slipdress with a blazer, or an oversize blouse and miniskirt,” Sample says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sample wears her pairs out and about with cropped pants, fitted dresses, and even leggings and a leather jacket en route to yoga. Her own experience serves as evidence that cowboy boots are more of an everyday style than they’re given credit for. Through Partlow, she says, “[w]e’re hoping to share this point of view and open people’s minds who might feel intimidated by cowboy boots, only associating them with ‘western style’ looks.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The designs were opening minds even before the official launch. On a long layover at a Paris airport following a factory visit in Italy, Lemkin was stopped by “several very chic Parisian women […] to ask where they could purchase my boot!” she says. “It was that moment, I realized that these boots were accomplishing what we set out to do: to transcend the idea of the cowboy boots outside of the western realm they have traditionally been situated in.”<br></p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Partlow Boots<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Halie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at Harper's BAZAAR.
