From ramen to lo mein and soba, noodles come in various shapes, sizes and textures to complement different ingredients. And for one variety that’s so easy to use and extra-versatile, we love glass noodles. These chewy, translucent strands soak up flavor like no other and cook almost instantly, whether stir-fried or mixed in a soup. We’re sharing two delicious recipes that take under 30 minutes, as well as expert cooking tips. So keep reading to learn everything about glass noodles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are glass noodles?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/glass-noodles.jpg><p>Glass noodles, also known as cellophane or bean thread noodles, originated in China. “Unlike traditional noodles made from wheat, glass noodles are typically made from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mung bean</a>, potato, <a href=#>sweet potato</a>, tapioca or rice starch,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avery Zenker</a>, a registered dietitian and writer for<strong> </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Everflex Fitness</a>. “When cooked, they become translucent, hence the name ‘glass noodles.'”</p><p>But don’t get them confused with rice vermicelli noodles, which are white in color. They usually come dry, then reconstitute in water before being cooked. Many love glass noodles for their delicate texture and ability to absorb the flavors of the dishes they’re cooked with.</p><p>In East Asian cuisines, glass noodles can be found in a variety of dishes including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stir fries</a>, soups, salads, spring rolls and hot pots (food cooked in simmering soup stock). They go great with vegetables, meats, seafood and flavorful sauces to create vibrant meals. You can cook them by boiling, soaking or stir-frying depending on the recipe.</p><p>Glass noodles don’t taste like much. Instead, they serve as a flavor conduit to other ingredients. And not all glass noodles look the same. While Chinese mung bean noodles look stringy, Korean sweet potato noodles or broad bean noodles come wide. Some variations are even flat, known as mung bean sheets. “They come in big packs of individually wrapped packets you can find at any Chinese grocery store,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaitlin and Sarah Leung</a>, cookbook authors and creators of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Woks of Life</a>, add.</p><p><strong>For more noodle dishes,</strong> read on for <a href=#>5 Types of Asian Noodles</a> and <a href=#>Keto-Friendly Kelp Noodles</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are glass noodles good for you?</h2><p>Glass noodles offer several health benefits, making them a popular choice if you want a nutritious alternative to wheat-based noodles. “Glass noodles are gluten-free, making them a good alternative for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease,” says Zenker. “Depending on the starch source, they can be lower in calories compared to traditional wheat noodles.” They also contain low levels of sugar and fat. However, because glass noodles don’t contain a lot of protein or fiber, Zenker suggests pairing them with other nutrient-rich ingredients like vegetables, meat or legumes.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Top MD: Nearly 50% of Us Have Some Type of Gluten Sensitivity&nbsp;and Fatigue Is a Top Symptom — How to Feel Better</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to cook glass noodles</h2><p>The best part about glass noodles is how fast they cook, 1-5 minutes compared to 8-10 for most dried pastas. This requires a bit more attention to detail, as you don’t want to overcook them. Cooking glass noodles may seem complicated, but it’s surprisingly easy with a few expert tips. We spoke to the experts who share their insights.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Soak noodles before cooking</h3><p>“‘[Glass noodles] typically need to be soaked in hot water for about 10 to 15 minutes or boiled for a few minutes until they become soft and transparent,” says Zenker. She reminds us to not “overcook them, as they can become too soft and lose their texture. Drain them well after soaking or boiling.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Cut them in half first</h3><p>“To make them easier to work with, you can then cut them in half once they are softened before throwing them in a wok or large sauté pan to cook alongside the other ingredients”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Get creative</h3><p>According to Kaitlin and Sarah, glass noodles “are super versatile and can be combined as a stir-fry with numerous other ingredients for a quick and healthy meal. Everything from cabbage and egg to chicken and pork with chilis, the sky’s the limit with your favorite ingredients you can add to the pan with glass noodles.” Try their traditional recipe called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ants Climbing A Tree</a>!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Two easy recipes using glass noodles</h2><p>Whether you’re craving a quick weeknight meal or a light and satisfying lunch, these two recipes are sure to become favorites in your kitchen.
