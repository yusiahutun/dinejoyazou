So, a top tip which may not seem like a lot, is to invest in a really good chef’s knife. I can't tell you how much easier my life has become since using a really good knife (in comparison to a small tomato knife that I used for everything). It makes the prepping process so much faster."</p><p id=eLTkpXvxdF40 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Kate Silverton's tips on calming children's back to school nerves</a></strong></p><p id=ekQvaiSOogdD data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Martine McCutcheon's top tips for a stress-free school run</a></strong></p><h3>Declutter your kitchen</h3><p id=eg_LSy0iyXgS data-wc=62>"My dad also always taught me that a, 'clear desk = clear mind'. Make sure your kitchen is clean and clear before you start. Trying to cook in a cluttered or messy kitchen can make the whole process seem very chaotic, but when you have a clear space to place out your bowls and ingredients, everything becomes much more organised and enjoyable."</p><h3>Get your children involved</h3><p id=e5DW4XRpQhf8 data-wc=45>"As long as they stay away from any sharp utensils and direct heat, meal prepping is definitely something that you can involve the kids with. Even if it's just crumbling feta into a bowl, or mixing a salad dressing together, it becomes a family activity."</p><h3>Create a music playlist</h3><p id=e0EnTcnc5z3A data-wc=35>"Lastly - put on a good playlist. Having your favourite music playing in the background will make the process so much more fun. I always cook with a playlist on in the background, without fail!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/98740459ded9-crystelle-pereira-salad-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e8izuFo7eqnK data-wc=5><strong>Crystelle shares her best ideas</strong></p><p id=erk493O_qPfD data-wc=20>Crystelle has revealed some amazing ways parents can zhuzh things up for kids. For example, mixing and matching cupboard staples!</p><p id=eXsDQ9roREnf data-wc=64>"Always think about flavour and texture which, for me, are the most important part of any dish, and are what keep dishes exciting and interesting," she explains. "For flavour, go to your store cupboard and make the most out of any jar or bottle of sauce you have. Things like pesto, sriracha, flavoured oils, tabasco or mustard, for example, which are all so versatile.</p><p id=eE6eI6dkfdbK data-wc=53>"You can add pesto to your salmon before it goes in the oven, or mix mustard with honey and olive oil for a quick salad dressing. If you're making a sandwich, mix some sriracha with mayo and spread that on your bread. Really utilise all of those ingredients in any way you can!"</p><p id=elhr0NrX43bT data-wc=42>But that's not all, ingredients such as nuts and seeds can go a long way. The TV star adds: "For texture: if you're making a salad, try and garnish it with something crunchy like nuts, seeds or some finely chopped raw carrots.</p><p id=e1CH0Wiz19xm data-wc=51>"In a sandwich, add some crunchy lettuce and some fresh herbs along with some slices of grilled chicken for a real mix of textures and fresh flavours. If you're making pasta, you can add some breadcrumbs tossed in a bit of oil, dried herbs and parmesan for a bit of crunch!"</p><p id=ev-3Wo6WrxW7 data-wc=40>To find out more about Crystelle and her amazing recipe ideas, follow her on <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Facebook</a>, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> and <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>TikTok</a>.
