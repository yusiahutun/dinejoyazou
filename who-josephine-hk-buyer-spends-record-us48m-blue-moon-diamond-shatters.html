He received a five-year jail term, but has not served one day in prison because the former Portuguese enclave does not have an extradition treaty with Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/11/13/71d119e1a994f86e187da6ac6ac3f9ef.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Macau's Court of Second Instance yesterday rejected&nbsp;appeals&nbsp;by Lau and Steven Lo Kit-sing against their bribery and money laundering convictions. The court upheld sentences of five years and three months against the pair.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The sale came only one day after Lau&nbsp;paid 28.7 million Swiss francs for a magnificent 16.08 carat pink diamond at Christie’s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pink stone was promptly renamed the “Sweet Josephine”. The blue has been renamed “The Blue Moon of Josephine”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Josephine's mother is Lau’s girlfriend, called Chan Hoi-wan, a former entertainment reporter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cushion-shaped blue stone, mounted on a ring, has the top grading of fancy vivid blue. A&nbsp;pre-sale estimate put its value at between&nbsp;US$35 million and&nbsp;US$55 million.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is a new record price for any gemstone and per carat,” David Bennett, worldwide chairman of Sotheby's international jewellery division, told a packed showroom in Geneva that erupted into applause on Wednesday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bennett said&nbsp;the buyer had immediately renamed the stone, noting that it had also set a world record for any jewel at more than US$4 million per carat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For me the Blue Moon was always the blue diamond of my career. I've never seen a more beautiful stone - its shape, colour and purity. It's a magical stone,” Bennett said.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">WATCH:&nbsp;Rare pink diamond bought by Hong Kong collector fetches over US$28 million</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau and fellow Hong Kong property&nbsp;developer Steven Lo Kit-sing were each given jail sentences of five years and three months by Macau's Court of First Instance last year after being found guilty of corruption and money laundering. But they will not serve any time unless they return to the city voluntarily.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The court found that Lau and Lo offered a HK$20 million bribe to disgraced public works chief Ao Man-long to secure the site for&nbsp;their La Scala luxury development.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau is also known as a collector of artworks and wine. His passion for art was revealed when he snapped up Andy Warhol's famous painting of Mao Zedong for US$17.4 million and Paul Gauguin's 1892 painting Te Poipoi (The Morning) for US$39.2 million - the highest amount paid by a Hongkonger for an artwork.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born in 1951 in Hong Kong with family roots in Guangdong's Chaozhou, Lau graduated from a university in Canada in 1974, and joined his family's business, which made ceiling fans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau built his wealth on the Hong Kong stock market in the 1980s, but analysts have pointed out that the tycoon, with his younger brother Thomas Lau Luen-hung, was better known for corporate takeovers than stock investments.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their reputation as corporate raiders was created when their investment unit, Evergo International Holdings, made a hostile bid for the Kadoorie family's Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels in 1987.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Evergo, which listed in 1983 as a ceiling fan manufacturer, was subsequently delisted in 1993 to become a subsidiary of Chinese Estates Holdings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apart from his relationship with Chan, Lau has another a long-time partner, Yvonne Lui, who gave birth to two children with the tycoon.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also has two other children from his previous marriage to&nbsp;Bo Wing-kam. They divorced in 1992.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau paid a record HK$1.4 million for&nbsp;a car number plate&nbsp;bearing&nbsp;the characters "1 LOVE U" during a Transport Department&nbsp;auction of personalised plates&nbsp;in 2006.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The plate was used on a Mercedes-Benz&nbsp;for his partners, according to local media reports.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The previous record for a diamond sale&nbsp;was held by the 24.78 carat&nbsp;Graff Pink, sold by Sotheby's for US$46.2 million in November&nbsp;2010.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The blue diamond stone was found in South Africa's famed Cullinan mine in January 2014. The seller was New York-based jeweller Cora International, according to Sotheby's.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The distinctive blue colour in diamonds is attributed to trace amounts of the element boron in the crystal structure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Royal jewels, coloured gemstones, and designer pieces by Van Cleef & Arpels, Cartier, and Harry Winston were among 410 lots that found new owners, bringing in US$139 million.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A fancy vivid purple-pink, pear-shaped diamond ring sold for 13.9 million francs, the second-highest lot of the night.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A 8.48 carat Burmese ruby and diamond ring that belonged to the late Maria-Jose, the last Queen of Italy, was stranded at 5.2 million francs, drawing gasps as it failed to meet its reserve price set by the seller.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Cartier diamond and pearl tiara that survived Germany's sinking of the Lusitania cruise liner 100 years ago, along with its Canadian owner Marguerite Lady Allan, whose two daughters perished, went for US$800,000 in heated bidding, doubling the low end of its estimate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A 15.20 carat fancy orange-pink diamond pendant owned by former James Bond actor Sean Connery fetched more than 4 million francs, tripling its estimate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Overall, it was an extraordinary evening,” Bennett said.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Fugitive lau spends big on diamonds</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomKusmZi5pnuQcW5xaGVmfLi0zmahqKuVpbWqusRmn6RlkqrGpr6MrKeeppSoerOxwqipnWWlqIF5uYybo66dXaK8sLqMnaCapZ%2BjsW6%2Fx5qrrZ2iqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fake-designer-bags.html><span>←</span><span>How To Spot a Fake Designer Bag</span></a>
