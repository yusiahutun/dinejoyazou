The duo chose to get married in Texas because that is where their love story began. They got hitched under the Texas sky. Scott had previously revealed that the wedding was going to be a rustic chic wedding. Reportedly the groom wore a very nice three piece gray suite while the bride wore a beautiful lacy gown. Other than that little bit of information as of yet there are no other details on their big day. The now Mrs. Porter met her husband on the set of the NBC show Friday Night Lights. He of course was a star on the show, while she at the time was a cheerleader at the University of Texas. Despite Texas being where the now husband and wife duo met, it is also the state where Kelsey was born and raised. That is right even though she has migrated to Los Angelese, where she is currently a casting producer for Shine America, the Lone Star state is where she calls home. Kelsey spends her days in LA doing a lot of casting for reality/doco series type shows.</p>More about Scott Porter and Kersey Mayfield Less about Scott Porter and Kersey Mayfield<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZoqpynpKl6sbvRrZyrZZGjsW63xKuqnrFdoq66ssieo50%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeremy-clarkson-lisa-hogan-diddly-squat-farm-clarksons-farm-spotlight-exclusive.html><span>←</span><span>Jeremy Clarkson and Lisa Hogan share the realities of working together on Clarkson's Farm and those</span></a>
