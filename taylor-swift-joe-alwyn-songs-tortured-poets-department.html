We’ve known him as the focus of many of Swift’s LPs, from Lover to Reputation, and the Conversations With Friends actor is certainly all over The Tortured Poets Department too. Of course, we can’t know for sure which songs are about him, but there’s lots of damning evidence. Here, we break down all the clues, allusions, and Easter eggs that seem to point to Alwyn. Listen to each track and read the full lyrics below.</p><img alt="london celebrity sightings february 10, 2019" title="London Celebrity Sightings - February 10, 2019" width=961 height=1441 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-seen-attending-the-vogue-bafta-news-photo-1713539777.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">GOR</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id title="“So Long, London”" data-anchor-id=so-long-london class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">“So Long, London”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Acting as a sort of mournful sister song to Swift’s Lover-era ode to Alwyn “London Boy,” this one continues the singer’s streak of emotional track fives. In this song, Swift seems to be singing to Alwyn (a.k.a. “London”) after their breakup, telling him he’ll find the right person even if things didn’t work out for the two of them. “Oh, the tragedy / So long, London / You’ll find someone.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the song, Swift expresses insecurities she felt in her relationship with Alwyn, such as when she sings: “And my friends said it isn’t right to be scared / Every day of a love affair / Every breath feels like rarest air / When you’re not sure if he wants to be there.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Swift also seems to suggest she was waiting for Alwyn to propose after their many years together. “You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues? / I died on the altar waitin’ for the proof.” (Throughout their time together, there were multiple occasions when fans believed the couple had secretly gotten engaged.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So (So) long (Long), London (London)<br>So (So) long (Long), London (London)<br>So (So) long (Long), London (London)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I saw, in my mind, fairy lights through the mist<br>I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift<br>Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin’ away<br>My spine split from carrying us up the hill<br>Wet through my clothes, weary bones got the chill<br>I stopped tryin’ to make him laugh, stopped tryin’ to drill the safe</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thinkin’, how much sad did you think I had<br>Did you think I had in me?<br>Oh, the tragedy<br>So long, London<br>You’ll find someone</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I didn’t opt in to be your odd man out<br>I founded the club she’s heard great things about<br>I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath<br>I stoppеd CPR, after all, it’s no use<br>The spirit was gonе, we would never come to<br>And I’m pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For so long, London<br>Stitches undone<br>Two graves, one gun<br>I’ll find someone</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And you say I abandoned the ship<br>But I was going down with it<br>My white-knuckle dyin’ grip<br>Holding tight to your quiet resentment<br>And my friends said it isn’t right to be scared<br>Every day of a love affair<br>Every breath feels like rarest air<br>When you’re not sure if he wants to be there</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So how much sad did you think I had<br>Did you think I had in me?<br>How much tragedy?<br>Just how low did you<br>Think I’d go ’fore I’d self-implode?<br>’Fore I’d have to go be free?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?<br>I died on the altar waitin’ for the proof<br>You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days<br>And I’m just getting color back into my face<br>I’m just mad as hell ’cause I loved this place for</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So (so) long (long), London (London)<br>Had (had) a (a) good (good) run (run)<br>A moment (moment) of warm sun (sun)<br>But I'm (I'm) not (not) the (the) one (one)<br>So (so) long (long), London (London)<br>Stitches (stitches) undone (undone)<br>Two (two) graves (graves), one gun (gun)<br>You'll (you'll) find (find) someone</p><h2 data-node-id title="“Fresh Out the Slammer”" data-anchor-id=fresh-out-the-slammer class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">“Fresh Out the Slammer”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The seventh track on The Tortured Poets Department is a slinking number in which Swift seems to compare the end of her relationship with Alwyn to serving time in jail. But once she’s “free” from the slammer, she is eager to rebound.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the chorus, Swift relates how she felt trapped in her relationship: “Gray and blue and fights and tunnels / Handcuffed to the spell I was under / For just one hour of sunshine / Years of labor, locks, and ceilings / In the shade of how he was feeling / But it’s gonna be all right, I did my time.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, she’s found a man who is helping her escape the heartbreak and those feelings of helplessness (seemingly <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a60547194/taylor-swift-matty-healy-songs-tortured-poets-department/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Matty Healy" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Matty Healy</a>, whom she started dating not long after she and Alwyn called it quits). “Now, pretty baby / I’m runnin’ back home to you / Frеsh out the slammer / I know who my first call will be to.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Interestingly, the line about “runnin’ back home” may imply that Healy and Swift had connected romantically at some point before the breakup with Alwyn, as fans had already speculated.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, pretty baby<br>I’m runnin’ back home to you<br>Fresh out the slammer<br>I know who my first call will be to<br>(Fresh out the slammer, oh)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another summer, takin’ cover, rolling thunder<br>He don’t understand me<br>Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter<br>He was with her in dreams</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gray and blue and fights and tunnels<br>Handcuffed to the spell I was under<br>For just one hour of sunshine<br>Years of labor, locks and ceilings<br>In the shade of how he was feeling<br>But it’s gonna be all right, I did my time</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, pretty baby<br>I'm runnin’ back home to you<br>Frеsh out the slammer<br>I know who my first call will be to<br>(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches<br>Toss the ashes off the ledge<br>As I said in my letters, now that I know better<br>I will never lose my baby again</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My friends tried, but I wouldn’t hear it<br>Watch me daily disappearing<br>For just one glimpse of his smile<br>All those nights, he kept me goin’<br>Swirled you into all of my poems<br>Now we’re at the starting line, I did my time</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, pretty baby<br>I’m runnin’</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)<br>To the one who says I’m the girl of his American dreams<br>And no matter what I’ve done, it wouldn’t matter anyway<br>Ain’t no way I’m gonna screw up now that I know what’s at stake here<br>At the park where we used to sit on children’s swings<br>Wearing imaginary rings</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But it’s gonna be all right, I did my time</p><h2 data-node-id title=“Florida!!!” data-anchor-id=florida class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">“Florida!!!”</h2><p id=3)-loml data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In this pulsing collaboration with Florence + the Machine, Swift describes Florida as a haven that she escapes to amid the death of a relationship. Tampa also happens to be the first city she performed in on the Eras Tour after the news broke of her split from Alwyn. She sings: “I need to forget, so take me to Florida / I’ve got some regrets, I’ll bury them in Florida.”</p><p id=3)-loml data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Elsewhere in the track, Swift describes her home as being “really only a town you’re just a guest in”—possibly referencing her departure from London after intermittently living across the pond to be with Alwyn.</p><p id=3)-loml data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too<br>They said I was a cheat, I guess it

data-anchor-id=loml class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">“loml”<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a classic Swiftian turn of phrase, the wordsmith takes an abbreviation that typically means “love of my life” and gives it a tragic twist, using it instead to refer to the “loss of my life”—presumably Alwyn.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Throughout the song, Swift sings of a great love lost: “If you know it in one glimpse, it’s legendary / You and I go from one kiss to getting marriеd / Still alive, killing time at the cеmetery / Never quite buried / And you suit and tie in the nick of time / You low-down boy, you stand-off guy / You holy ghost, you told me I’m the love of your life / You said I’m the love of your life / About a million times.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But despite the love and hopes the two had for this relationship, it wasn’t meant to last. “If you know it in one glimpse, it’s legendary,” she sings. “What we thought was for all time was momentary.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the past, Swift has often sung about how she thought her relationship with Alwyn would last forever, on track from “Lover” to “New Year’s Day.” However, this song digs into those feelings when you realize you were wrong.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Who’s gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames<br>If we know the steps anyway?<br>We embroidered the memories of the time I was away<br>Stitching, “We were just kids, babe”<br>I said, “I don’t mind, it takes time”<br>I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed<br>I’ve felt a glow like this never before and never since</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you know it in one glimpse,

css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">“I Can Do It With a Broken Heart”<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On this deceptively upbeat track, Swift gets candid about what it was like to perform through the heartbreak—while fans around the globe were cheering and singing along with the singer at her sold-out Eras Tour shows.</p><p data-journey-content=true

class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair reportedly called it quits right as Swift embarked on her tour, which is currently the highest-grossing concert tour of all time and is set to continue with a European leg in May.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=66 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, Swift reveals that when the shows began, she was secretly struggling: “’Cause I’m a real tough kid / I can handle my shit / They said, ‘Babe, you gotta fake it ’til you make it’ and I did / Lights, camera, bitch, smile / Even when you wanna die / He said he’d love me all his life.”</p><p

End?”<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=76 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In this soft piano ballad, Swift hauntingly recalls the aftermath of a breakup (“We hereby conduct / This post-mortem”), revealing that she and her ex planned to keep the intimate knowledge of their split between them and their inner circle of close friends. Still, she knows that won’t stop the public from speculating about the relationship’s end, even as she is caught in the throes of romantic grief: “Come one, come all / It’s happenin’ again / The empathetic hunger descends / We’ll tell no one / Except all of our friends / We must know / How did it end?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=77 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The former couple’s decision to keep the details of their breakup private is reminiscent of Alwyn’s known desire to stay out of the spotlight throughout the duration of his relationship with Swift. In an April 2024 interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a39712686/joe-alwyn-conversations-with-friends-taylor-swift-privacy-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elle UK" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Elle UK</a>, the actor reflected on at: “It’s not really [because I] want to be guarded and private, it’s more a response to something else. We live in a culture that is so increasingly intrusive.…The more you give—and frankly, even if you don’t give it—something will be taken.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=78 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed, Swift expresses a contempt for the public’s inevitable reaction to their split. In one verse, she speculates about what people will say upon hearing the news: “Guess who we ran into at the shops? / Walking in circles like she was lost / Didn’t you hear? / They called it all off / One gasp and then / How did it end?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=80 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We hereby conduct<br>This post-mortem<br>He was a hothouse flower to my outdoorsmen<br>Our maladies was such<br>We could not cure them<br>And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=81 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Come one, come all<br>It’s happenin’ again<br>The empathetic hunger descends<br>We’ll tell no one<br>Except all of our friends<br>We must know<br>How did it end?<br>(Uh-oh, uh-oh)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=82 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We were blind to unforeseen circumstances<br>We learn the right steps to differеnt dances (Oh, oh-oh)<br>And fell victim to interlopеrs’ glances<br>Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?<br>Soon, they’ll go home to their husbands<br>Smug ’cause they know they can trust him<br>Then feverishly calling their cousins (Oh, oh)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=83 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Guess who we ran into at the shops?<br>Walking in circles like she was lost<br>Didn’t you hear?<br>They called it all off<br>One gasp and then<br>How did it end?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=84 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Say it once again with feeling<br>How the death rattle breathing<br>Silenced as the soul was leaving<br>The deflation of our dreaming<br>Leaving me bereft and reeling<br>My beloved ghost and me<br>Sitting in a tree<br>D-Y-I-N-G</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=85 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s happenin’ again<br>How did it end?<br>I can’t pretend like I understand<br>How did it end?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=86 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Come one, come all<br>It’s happenin’ again<br>The empathetic hunger descends<br>We’ll tell no one<br>Except all of our friends<br>But I still don’t know<br>How did it end?</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/04e4fe03-f532-4e6a-8cd4-455131aa4449_1702400410.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Joel Calfee" title="Headshot of Joel Calfee" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Joel is the editorial and social media assistant for HarpersBAZAAR.com, where he covers all things celebrity news.
