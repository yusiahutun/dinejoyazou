However, here are some details about her.</strong></p><p>Kevin Costner first rose to prominence due to his acting skills in the 1980s. At the time, the actor was married to his college sweetheart, the beautiful Cindy Silva.&nbsp;For almost two decades, the couple stayed and supported each other. Back then, they were one of the famous couples whose relationship was a model for most people.&nbsp;</p><p>But it all came crashing down in 1994 when the couple announced their split. The news shocked most who heard it because up until then, Costner and Silva’s relationship looked unshakable.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/4a/da/72/4ada72a530c9d7280e75065f786ffe1d.jpg><p>Although the reason for their surprising divorce dominated front pages for weeks, it was subsequently displaced by their divorce proceedings. After the couple announced they had amicably settled all issues concerning their kids and finances, the financial settlement caused a stir.&nbsp;</p><p>According to reports, Silva got a divorce settlement of $80 million, which at that time was one of the <a href=#>costliest</a> divorce settlement. After the separation, Costner disclosed how heartbroken he felt about the whole situation. He <a href=#>noted</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“My faith was shaken. No one wants their marriage to end, and it did. You are going to see the people you love most, your children, only half as much. That’s a huge loss.”</strong></p><p>After their separation, the actor got together with actress Bridget Rooney. Despite that they had a child, the relationship did not last. It looked like Costner would not get to experience what he did with Silva until he hooked up with Christine Baumgartner.&nbsp;</p><p>Although they experienced some troubles initially, the pair have been <a href=#>married </a>since 2014. During this time, they have also become parents to three children. Nonetheless, let’s take a deep look at the lady who has stolen the heart of one of our favorite actors.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Christine_Baumgartner></span><strong>Who is Christine Baumgartner?&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christine Baumgartner is a 48-year-old American woman. She was born on March 4, 1974. Baumgartner is 19 years old, younger than Costner. Back in the 1980s, she worked as a model and was relatively successful.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>graduated </a>from the California State University in Fullerton with a bachelor’s degree in business. Baumgartner is also a recognized handbag designer.&nbsp; Her handbag line, “Cat Bag Couture,” is famous for its fashionable laptop bags.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/59/01/c8/5901c8029a27e4625e948373aa14d442.jpg><p>The brand’s purses were also very popular in the mid-2000s and were even&nbsp; featured on the reality series “Desperate Housewives.” Since marrying Costner, Baumgartner has welcomed three children with the veteran actor.&nbsp;</p><p>Their first child, son Cayden, arrived in 2007, followed by their second son Haynes in 2009. The couple’s last-born daughter Grace was born in 2010. She had managed to be a mother together with being a businesswoman.&nbsp;</p><p>Baumgartner has also appeared on the screen. She has made appearances on shows like “Inside Edition,” “Entertainment Tonight,” and “E! Live from the Red Carpet.” But, despite being a businesswoman, the mother of four is not on social media.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Couple_Recently_Appeared_Together_At_The_Oscars></span><strong>The Couple Recently Appeared Together At The Oscars</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kevin Costner and his wife Christine Baumgartner were one of the couples that dazzled fans at the 2022 Oscar Awards. Baumgartner <a href=#>wore </a>a black and white ballgown with intricate lace designs, while Costner kept it simple with a tuxedo and black bowtie.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/d7/6a/5a/d76a5a95ff06b6a3d6378be9bfc42a14.jpg><p>The actor was at the event to present an award and was a recipient in 1991 when he won Best Director and Best Picture. The couple’s kids were noticeably absent, as expected. Costner had always been vocal about their attempts to keep the kids away from the spotlight.</p><p>Kevin Costner’s wife and their kids spend most of their best time on their family’s165-acre Dunbar Ranch just outside Aspen, Colorado. The ranch has three lakes and a river running through it.</p><p>The actor has admitted that raising his kids with Baumgartner alongside their step-siblings from his previous relationships has not always been easy.&nbsp;</p><p>Costner acknowledged that as his kids interact, there is always a sense of questioning about which sets he cares for the most. However, he has taught them that there is room enough for him to love all of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqOVq7avecKoqq2mlafAbsPIn5xmp5Zisqqzx61ksp2Rp8Bur8eroKysmaOybq7ArqSgmaKpu6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./want-hong-kong-experience-drink-outside-7-eleven.html><span>←</span><span>Want a Hong Kong experience?
