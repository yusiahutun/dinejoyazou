After all, a gloomy aesthetic doesn't necessarily equate sadness — it can become a powerful manifestation of power and your dark feminine energy. We're talking smoky eyes, dark lipstick, and lots of black liner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To better understand what the makeup trend and how to do it at home, we tapped a celebrity makeup artist to answer all our questions and give us some beauty inspiration for the fall. Their answers, below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-goth-glam></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Goth Glam?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Goth glam is typically a monochromatic and moody look, achieved with heavy eye makeup like liners and shadows, a bold lip, and minimal contouring in a range of darker hues," explains celebrity makeup artist and Ulta Beauty Pro Team member <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">Deney Adam</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike other dark, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>grungey makeup</a> trends though, goth glam isn't intentionally (or accidentally) mess or over-the top à la Julia Fox. No. Goth glam is more poised, put-together. It's glam, feminine, dark, broody, and powerful.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The Unexpected Eye Makeup Color That's About to Be Everywhere</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-is-goth-glam-trending-now></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Is Goth Glam Trending Now?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Celebrity influence has heavily backed this trend, with A-listers like Lizzo, Kourtney Kardashian, and Karlie Kloss making appearances at the Met Gala, award shows, and even their weddings with goth-influence heavily stated in their glam," says Adam.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The celebrity effect is real, and the takeover of goth glam over "clean girl" is a predictable next step into fall. Trends tend to swing like a pendulum, so going from the popular no-makeup makeup look to full-on dark cosmetics and borderline indie sleaze is simply history repeating itself. Plus, Adam points out that there's a nostalgic angle to it, too. After all, who can forget the grunge aesthetic of the '90s and early 2000s?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We're ready to give into the dark side, and if you are too, keep scrolling for some major beauty inspo to influence your next few months of beauty looks.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kourtney-kardashian></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kourtney Kardashian</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We can't talk about goth glam without mentioning the eldest Kardashian sister. Her approach to the trend is a lot simpler than the prior examples, making it more beginner-friendly for those seeking to simply dip their toes into the trend.</p><p>"For a simpler look that still has goth influence, smudge a dark liner or shadow around the top and bottom lash line and on to the lids," says Adam. "Add a black liner to the water line, keeping the rest of the face mild to neutral to bring focus to the eyes."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2ifn6m1brPLmqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-to-wear-chinese-new-year.html><span>←</span><span>Chinese New Year fashion buys</span></a>
