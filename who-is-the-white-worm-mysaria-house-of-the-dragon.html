But who exactly is the White Worm? And why are they so important?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, we break down the identity of this character and the integral role they'll soon play. <strong>Beware, spoilers are ahead</strong><strong>.</strong></p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Who is the White Worm?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As previous episodes hinted, Mysaria is the ring master known as the White Worm, controlling the lucrative network of spies in King's Landing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mysaria was first introduced as a sex worker in Episode 1, with Prince Daemon as her main patron. After King Viserys names Princess Rhaenyra as his heir instead of Daemon, the prince flees King's Landing for Dragonstone. He brings Mysaria with him, intending to make her his second wife. In the process, he steals a dragon egg, claiming that the egg is for his and Mysaria's unborn child. When Princess Rhaenyra and Otto Hightower march onto Dragonstone to retrieve the egg, Daemon inadvertently puts Mysaria's life at risk. It's revealed that she, in fact, was not pregnant and that Daemon had flirted with her chance at surviving the conflict just to provoke his brother, the king. Mysaria is furious at Daemon's scheme and realizes that, if she wants liberation, she must take the matter into her own hands.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mysaria returns in Episode 4. After Daemon and Rhaenyra's tryst at a pleasure house in King's Landing, Daemon wakes up hungover in a dwelling owned by Mysaria. She begrudingly takes care of him as he recovers, but she also has other intentions. The same boy who witnesses Daemon and Rhaenyra's nighttime rendezvous, and subsequently tells Otto of the affair, silently hands Mysaria the money he receives from Otto. This exchange indicates that Mysaria is the person pulling the strings when it comes to controlling the currency of secrets and gossip. In this episode, she also explains to Daemon that she no longer works in the sex trade. "I learned that the skin trade could only take me so far in this life," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She again appears in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a41574536/house-of-the-dragon-episode-8-ending-explained-recap/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Episode 8" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Episode 8</a>. Talya, the handmaid to Queen Alicent, is revealed to be one of Mysaria's working spies. Talya has been present for many damning events for the Hightowers at the Red Keep, including Prince Aegon's rape of a servant named Dyana and Alicent's subsequent cover-up of Aegon's treachery.</p><img alt=mysaria title=mysaria width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sonoya-mizuno-1666023725.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Ollie Upton / HBO</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a41634544/house-of-the-dragon-episode-9-ending-explained-recap/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Episode 9" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Episode 9</a>, Mysaria plays a central role in locating Aegon after the death of King Viserys. Bartering with Otto, she divulges his location on the condition that Otto shut down a fighting pit in which children are forced to fight to the death—a place Aegon is known to frequent. She also warns Otto that those in power only rule with the consent of the common folk, saying, "There is no power but what the people allow you to take."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In George R.R.
