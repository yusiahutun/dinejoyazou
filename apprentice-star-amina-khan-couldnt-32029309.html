But when she was 13, she made a promise to herself.</p><p>When she was a teenager, she vowed she'd be a "millionaire" one day. And it's safe to say she totally turned her life around by starting her own skincare business.</p><p>She said: "When I was 13 years old, I remember sitting in school one day and made a pact to myself that I would do whatever it takes to become a millionaire. Having grown up in an underprivileged background with two immigrant parents trying to make ends meet, I have been relentlessly grinding since then to get to where I am today...</p><p>"I started my business from zero and made my first turnover of £1million within two years of launching my skincare and supplements brand. I achieved all this with no investment, no business background, no social media following and only in-house marketing.</p><p>"To think, I couldn’t even afford a cheeky Nando’s three years ago!"</p><h2>When is The Apprentice on TV?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32021075.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_MAIN_-STAR_Claude-Littner-.jpg><p>The Apprentice series 18 airs on <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>BBC</a> One on Thursdays at 9pm. Each episode lasts for an hour and is available on iPlayer following all the action.</p><p>In 2024, the first episode of the series was shown on February 1. There are 12 episodes in total, so we still have a while to go yet.</p><p>To get a debrief of each episode, and watch interviews with the fallen candidates, you can also tune into The Apprentice: You’re Fired. It’s hosted by comedian Tom Allen and airs on Thursdays at 10pm on BBC Two.</p><h2>Who are The Apprentice judges in 2024?</h2><p><a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Lord Alan Sugar</a> is the main judge of The Apprentice – and ultimately decides who he wants to go into business with. He's well-placed for this role, considering he has an estimated net worth of £1.21bn.</p><p>Lord Sugar is helped by Baronness <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Karren Brady</a>, one of the most influential female business leaders in Britain. He also gets words of wisdom from Tim Campbell, an entrepreneur who won The Apprentice back in 2005.</p><p>Claude Littner is another beloved adviser on the show, but he won't be sitting alongside Lord Sugar in the boardroom this series. This is reportedly due to "medical issues".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZK6xvNGepa2hk5p6tMDAq2SapZmjrm63x5qlZpufqrmlutNmamtoYm6AcYU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-jackson-sent-his-chimpanzee-bubbles-to-party-with-bon-jovi-he-partied-like-a-rockstar.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Jackson sent his chimpanzee Bubbles to party with Bon Jovi - 'He partied like a rockstar'</span></a>
