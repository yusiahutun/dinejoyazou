When we celebrate our birthday, we are marking our chronological age - how many years we’ve been alive. But we don’t all age at the same rate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Factors such as stress, sleep and diet affect how our organs cope with daily life, which means that our biological age could be quite different from our chronological age.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is where “ageing clocks” come in. They calculate the wear and tear on your organs and predict how many healthy years you have left.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first such clock was developed in 2013 by Steve Horvath and it’s still one of the best-known today. The Horvath clock estimates the age of almost every organ in the body using data from 51 body tissues and cells.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then there have been plenty of ageing clocks. Most of them estimate a person’s biological age.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But a new one -Zhavoronkov claims it is the first of its kind – aims to determine a person’s psychological age, and in turn boost mental health.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/29/b075bd44-3286-4bba-a77c-923a43dc9aca_55773cb1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">FuturSelf, developed by Deep Longevity, is a free online application in which users take a 10-minute survey that determines their psychological age – whether they are psychologically younger or older than their actual age.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is a great clock to introduce longevity mindfulness,” Zhavoronkov says. “It’s the easiest clock to change and the easiest clock to experiment with. Basically, what you are doing is identifying those wrinkles in your psychology.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The app asks you to rate yourself on a sliding scale on topics including “I know what I want out of life”, “How much can I rely on my friends for help if I have a serious problem?”, “I like most parts of my personality”, “Society isn’t improving for people like me” and “I can do just about anything I set my mind to”.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">In China … [t]hey just went through dramatic hardships [due to the pandemic] and probably got psychologically older – if your optimism goes down, you get olderAlex Zhavoronkov</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A report with insights aimed at improving your long-term mental health and well-being is sent to your email afterwards, with an option to enrol in a free guidance programme.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This reporter enjoyed the test, not only because it was quick and easy, but because her reported age was 14 years younger than her chronological age. Who doesn’t want to shave off a decade? But there was more good news from Zhavoronkov.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have a paper showing that people who are younger psychologically live longer as well. So it’s a strong predictor of how long you will live, because you have a purpose in life,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/29/2bbf2e5b-7bb0-4519-91fa-71f08ad27230_9833b9fe.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If your results show that you are significantly older than your chronological age, you can act on the suggestions to improve this.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Broadly speaking, Zhavoronkov says younger people are more creative, more imaginative, take more risks and have broader horizons even though they may feel lonely, whereas older people tend to be happier.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We get happier as we age, everything else gets worse. It makes us more content with our imminent decline and death,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He hopes that FuturSelf will direct attention towards the value of AI for psychoanalysis and sees a huge potential market in mainland China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In China there should be a boom in that area because their psychological counselling is not well developed. They just went through dramatic hardships [due to the pandemic] and probably got psychologically older – if your optimism goes down, you get older,” he says.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I don’t want to have a family.

My company – and everything I do in life – is focused on thisAlex Zhavoronkov</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Professor Vadim Gladyshev, a biogerontology expert at Harvard Medical School, says the FuturSelf app broadens how we view ageing and the transitions through life stages and emotional states.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[It] offers an interesting perspective on psychological age, future well-being and risk of depression, and demonstrates a novel application of machine-learning approaches to the issues of psychological health,” Gladyshev says.</p>AI systems are revolutionising nearly every aspect of our lives and have already proven to be accurate in predicting human behaviour. FuturSelf, and the work that follows from it, has the potential to help many millions of people around the world, and though it is never going to replace <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a human therapist</span></a>, it’s empowering to recognise that while we all get a little older each day, we can take action to remain youthful.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">No kids by choice for longevity-obsessed Alex Zhavoronkov</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhavoronkov is so focused on researching and better understanding healthy productive longevity that he’s decided not to reproduce.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t want to have a family.
