Since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex decided to leave the UK for their family, they have embarked on several ventures. The 38-year-old prince released a bombshell memoir where he called brother <a href=#>Prince William</a> his ‘arch nemesis’ as well as other allegations against The Firm. <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Harry also sat down for a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey just a year after quitting. Now, commentator Kinsey Schofield says the recent rift is down to Prince Harry and Meghan seeking ‘revenge’ against <a href=#>royal family</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-royal-family-in-desperate-need-for-peace-and-that-s-not-from-meghan-and-harry>Royal family in ‘desperate need for peace, and that’s not from Meghan and Harry’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1242969989-1024x682.jpg><p>Kinsey Schofield <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> TalkTv that she believes Prince Harry or Meghan were not invited to the royal family’s upcoming celebration of <a href=#>King Charles</a> 75th birthday.</p><p>Over the weekend, a report in The Sunday Times claimed the Sussexes turned down an invitation to attend the special occasion. They alleged the parents of two didn’t want to travel to the UK to celebrate the King’s birthday.</p><p>“There’s an open wound when it comes to Prince Harry and the royal family,” she said.</p><p>“So, I do believe that Prince Harry and Meghan were not invited to celebrate the King’s birthday with the family. Because I think the family is just in desperate need of peace right now. Harry and Meghan are toxic. They’re the absolute opposite of peace, and it’s just not what the family needs to heal.”</p><p>However, an official spokesperson for Prince Harry and Meghan has come out to say the royal family’s latest story is not true.</p><p>They said: “There has been no contact regarding an invitation to His Majesty’s upcoming birthday.” They also slammed the outlet for ‘misreporting’ the story.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-another-supporter-for-the-sussexes>‘It’s another supporter for the Sussexes’</h2><p>Kinsey went on to claim she thinks Harry and Meghan could have worked with him, like his previous book.</p><p>She said: “If they continue to claim they don’t work with Harry and Meghan like with Finding Freedom, which we found out was a lie, I would say Princess Eugenie would be probably nervous. That’s the only person that I would see maybe communicating with him other than Harry and Meghan, and she’s close in their corner.</p><p>“I imagine that this is just another arm, another tentacle when it comes to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s never-ending revenge saga.”</p><p>In 2020, the Duchess finally admitted she did help with Omid Scobie’s previous unofficial book. In the royal’s lawsuit against the Mail On Sunday’s parent company, Associated Newspapers, the revelation was made.</p><p>Meghan apologized for misleading the court over her recollection of the information her aides gave the authors for her unauthorized biography. Jason Knauf, who worked at the palace as their communications secretary, provided emails with the authors of the book. In a witness statement, he said the book was “discussed” on a routine basis, and “directly with the duchess multiple times” in person and in emails.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bombshell-new-book-will-cause-a-stir>Bombshell new book will cause a stir</h2><p>Omid Scobie’s new book is set to open up the royal feud once again.</p><p>The royal author, who wrote Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan in 2021, is a close friend of the couple.</p><p>However, other experts have said it’s a scathing attack on The Firm and remaining royals left working for the monarch. Angela Levin has called out the book, with Kinsey also detailing that it may put some of them in the spotlight on who spoke to Omid for the exclusives.</p><p>Commentators say it’s brining up allegations that the Sussexes claimed to <a href=#>celebrity</a> friend Oprah in 2021. During their bombshell interview, they claimed a member of The Firm made a racist comment on their upcoming child, Archie, before his birth.</p><p>Following the release, Prince William flat-out denied the royals were racist to reporters while at an event. The <a href=#>Queen</a>, at the time, along with Buckingham Palace, released a statement as well. In their response, they said they would deal with the issues raised as a family. They left it as a private family matter and hasn’t said anything since, even with Harry’s book release.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WFcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYp5xdorKotMCnZKaZoqC5pr%2BMp5yvnaJisq%2BwyKeeZqqVq7Kvs8Rmq5qjlah6onnTrqmnZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./khloe-kardashian-bronde-hair-color.html><span>←</span><span>Khlo Kardashian Dyes Her Hair Bronde</span></a>
