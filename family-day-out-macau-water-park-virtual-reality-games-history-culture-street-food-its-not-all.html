By the early 20th century, this was one of the city’s three major industries and orders came in from around the world. The industry began to decline in the 1970s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite how lucrative they were, people did not want firecracker factories near their homes because of the danger of explosion they posed.

Its factory was the largest – 20,000 square metres (215,000 sq ft) – with a layout designed for maximum safety and efficiency. There were multiple blast walls to protect against explosions, and water reservoirs in place to stop fires from spreading.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Former Iec Long Firecracker Factory site on Casa Dos Pinheiros Da Taipa has been open to the public since December 2022 and, while many of the buildings are long gone, you can still walk around and enjoy the atmosphere created by the towering banyan trees growing there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/17/c8fe39bb-f6d2-41f6-a2a3-e60889d130d1_798e21ed.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the few restored buildings is now a small museum that looks back at the history of the firecracker industry in Macau.

There, on Avenida de Carlos da Maia, you will find the beautiful yellow Our Lady of Carmel Church. It is a good photo spot but be mindful that only Catholics intending to pray go inside.</p>Head down another set of steps, and along Estrada de Cacilhas you will see a row of green Portuguese-style houses, some of which are open to the public.
