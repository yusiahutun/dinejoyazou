In the last one, he played a Mad Max kind of character and, in one scene, strips to his boxers.</p><p>This led fans to believe he is set to join the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> in the iconic Wolverine role. Hugh is set to leave the part after starring alongside Ryan Reynolds in the upcoming third installment of Deadpool. He has carried several films as the beloved character of Logan so far.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Harry Potter legend leaves huge $6 million fortune after his devastating death</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-star-underwent-lie-detector-test-to-tell-the-truth>Star underwent lie detector test to tell the truth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>But it was when it came down to a lie detector test when he finally spoke out. Before the hilarious clip, he hadn’t responded to the claims on the internet.</p><p>Asked jokingly if he had started the Wolverine rumors by his Broadway co-star Lindsey Mendez, Daniel gave an emphatic “no”. He then joked that he had “got buff for no reason.”</p><p>“Because I am obsessive,” he explained. Daniel then went on about his mom and dad, who are apparently very into their fitness.</p><p>“You’ve seen my parents. They’re like insane fitness people, so that’s just been passed on. But no, no Wolverine.”</p><p>So, there you have it. We won’t see a Harry Potter and Marvel crossover.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-devastated-by-co-star-s-death>Devastated by co-star’s death</h2><p>The 34-year-old recently paid tribute to his onscreen headmaster, Sir Michael Gambon, who played Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movies. Michael <a href=#>passed away in September</a> at the age of 82.</p><p>Daniel paid <a href=# rel=nofollow>tribute</a> to Variety: “With the loss of&nbsp;Michael Gambon&nbsp;the world just became considerably less fun. Michael Gambon was one of the most brilliant, effortless actors I’ve ever had the privilege of working with, but despite his immense talent, the thing I will remember most about him is how much fun he had doing his job.</p><p>“He was silly, irreverent and hilarious. He loved his job, but never seemed defined by it,” Daniel continued.</p><p>The celebrity who is now living in New York, added: “He was an incredible story and joke teller and his habit of blurring the lines of fact and fiction when talking to journalists meant that he was also one of the most entertaining people with whom you could ever wish to do a press junket.</p><p>“The sixth film was where I got to spend the most time working with Michael and he made the hours spent in front of a green screen together more memorable and joyous than they had any right to be,” Radcliffe added.</p><p>“I’m so sad to hear he has passed, but I am so grateful for the fact that I am one of the lucky people who got to work with him.”</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Harry Potter favorite ‘hasn’t aged in 20 years’ as they show off hair transformation</a></strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aGcLTAq6myZaCkwbWx0WaqrZmiYrOqusClo7Jlk6S6pr%2BMnKOemZ5ivK951qijr52inrumedGupKiqo2Kup8DEq2SgnaSptq%2BzjKugqaiVmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aldi-supermarket-marks-spencer-blind-17119392.html><span>←</span><span>Aldi and M&amp;amp;S steaks put through blind taste test so which wins?</span></a>
