The Italian style icon has been a close friend of her father’s, famed ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, since they both appeared in the 1985 film <i>White Nights</i>, Rossellini’s first movie in America. So when Baryshnikov and Rossellini met up in Midtown Manhattan for <i>InStyle</i>’s January Style Crush chat, it was a family reunion, of sorts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After greeting each other with big hugs, the two sat down for coffee in an empty dance studio at the Baryshnikov Arts Center and caught up on everything from their recent projects (Baryshnikov stars in Apple TV+’s Dickinson; Rossellini has the upcoming film <i>Silent Life</i>) to family updates (Baryshnikov’s father, Mikhail, also stopped in to say hello with the family dog in tow).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Naturally, the conversation turned to style — a topic that both women love. “Basically you’ve been my style inspiration since the third grade,” said Baryshnikov, as she quizzed Rossellini on her favorite designers and her red carpet process. One common thread between the two actresses? The inspiration that they both received while growing up in extremely stylish families.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve learned a lot about style from my family,” said Baryshnikov. “My dad will never wear anything he doesn’t feel comfortable in, and I’ve always taken that to heart. Style is so much more than what you wear — it’s how you carry yourself, how comfortable you feel, and how you express yourself.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Isabella Rossellini with her mother, Ingrid Bergman, in 1974. Mondadori Portfolio/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rossellini, whose mother was actress Ingrid Bergman (above) and father was director Roberto Rossellini, felt a similar way. “One of the biggest advantages of growing up in our wonderful families is we learned that style can come from anything — the museum you’re visiting, the book you’re reading. My parents were a great example of that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for their full chat, as they discuss the pressures of the red carpet, wearing couture on a farm, and a shared love of super chic menswear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>ANNA BARYSHNIKOV:</strong> Isabella, we haven’t seen each other in a long time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>ISABELLA ROSSELLINI:</strong> I know! But I’ve known you since you were born. I’ve been friends with your father since we filmed White Nights in the ’80s. He always makes me laugh so much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> There were many photos of you around the house when I was growing up. I went through a phase where I only wanted to wear boyish clothes, and my mom [ballet dancer Lisa Rinehart] showed me a picture of you in the most beautiful suit. Basically, you’ve been my style inspiration since the third grade. [laughs]</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Anna Baryshnikov in Khaite. ANGELA WEISS/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> That’s sweet. For me, dressing like a man has always been practical. Most women have to dress for the gym, the office, and the cocktail party. But men, they found a solution. They wear the same suit all day — and they’ve got pockets! So I started to wear suits too because they work for every occasion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB: </strong>So true! Lately, I’ve been into the brand <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Khaite</a> because their clothes make me feel powerful and feminine but are still really modern and wearable. Are there any designers you are loving right now?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> I’m very close to Domenico Dolce [of Dolce & Gabbana]. But the last time I spoke to him, I said, “When I go to your shops, there is nothing bigger than a size 8 or 10, and I’m not a size 8 or 10 anymore.” I’m like the majority of women in their 60s. So where are we supposed to buy clothes? Yes, Eileen Fisher serves us, but sometimes you want a little bit more fantasy. So Domenico promised he’d make some clothes for me, and then he sent over four incredibly beautiful dresses.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Isabella Rossellini in Dolce & Gabbana. CHRIS DELMAS/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> You walked in the Dolce & Gabbana show in 2018, right?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> Yes! Family is important to Italians, so they hired my daughter [Elettra Wiedemann], my son-in-law [Caleb Lane], my grandchild [Ronin], and my son [Roberto Rossellini], and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>we all walked the runway</a>. I was the shortest one. [laughs]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> You have a uniquely gorgeous family, so you were a good pick!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> I liked that the show had a message of inclusiveness. It was modern and unexpected because it wasn’t just skinny models.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> I’ve learned a lot about style from my family too. My dad will never wear anything he doesn’t feel comfortable in, and I’ve always taken that to heart. Style is so much more than what you wear — it’s how you carry yourself, how comfortable you feel, and how you express yourself. But it can be tricky too. I remember being 10-years-old in an H&M store, saying, “Mom, I want to look like an Édith Piaf song!” And she was like, “Anna, just pick a winter coat, please.” [laughs]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> One of the biggest advantages of growing up in our wonderful families is we learned that style can come from anything — the museum you’re visiting, the book you’re reading. My parents [actress Ingrid Bergman and director Roberto Rossellini] were a great example of that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> I love that you talk about inclusivity and affordability because I really hope that’s where the fashion industry is going.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Anna Baryshnikov in Khaite. Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> The prices are so very high. Do I want Chanel and Dolce & Gabbana? Yes, but we all buy Uniqlo and Gap too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> And for many young people, it’s not even on the table to afford something so expensive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> Of course. And as actresses and models, we get sent a lot of this stuff, so it creates this unfair illusion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> Now, I’m starting to get to a place in my life where I actually don’t want to own a lot of things.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> I agree. A sense of consumerism in a world that has so many environmental problems feels like waste, not abundance. So yes, one wants to pare it down, but still have the fantasy. I mean, I’m not a good example, I’m dressed in all black today. And I resent myself because it’s a shortcut. [laughs]</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Isabella Rossellini in Dolce & Gabbana. David M. Benett/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> You have a lot of experience on the red carpet. How do you know you’re wearing the right thing for an event?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> It’s hard, isn't it? I do very few red carpets now because I feel like a monkey on a string. There’s a judgmental eye and always someone to say, “Who wore it best?” I could just wear black pants and a nice shirt, but sometimes I want more joy and surprise. But then I think, “Why do I need a gala to wear my beautiful clothes?” I should be at my farm wearing all of my gowns. [laughs]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> They would look gorgeous in the country! There is this pressure to wear the right thing, but it’s only right if you’re happy in it. I’ve been trying to focus on how I feel when I put something on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> That’s a good way to think about it. People ask me, “How did you find your sense of style?” And the truth is I never really thought about it much. I just wore what felt right at the time. Today I’m comfortable in black, thanks to the fashion world. But other days I want a pop of color. I’ve always loved the clothes by the Hong Kong-based designer Shanghai Tang because they had this incredible electric color for the lining.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> A special detail on the inside is so personal. As a New Yorker, I also love my black, but I’m not that stereotypical ’90s New York woman who is, like, cutting in front of a line. [laughs] I like the inherent simplicity of muted colors.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Anna Baryshnikov in Dior. Gregory Pace/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> I’ve always thought that Jane Goodall was so very elegant in her simplicity. She’s running after chimpanzees, going to conferences, meeting the president, and she doesn’t have the time to do much, but she’s found a way with her ponytail and her white shirt. That can be style too, you know?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> Last question: What did you like to wear when you were in your 20s?</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Isabella Rossellini in Stella McCartney. Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>IR:</strong> My last few years of school in Italy, I studied design. At one point, I thought I might become a costume designer, but I certainly didn’t know that I would eventually become a model and that fashion would be such a big part of my life. It was all about the miniskirt back then. It was sexy in a way that was very empowering. But then I was immediately like, “Oh, no, my legs aren’t good enough!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>AB:</strong> Ha! Well, I think you were always a style icon. And you continue to be, in the most modern way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i>For more stories like this, pick up the January issue of </i>InStyle<i>, available on newsstands, on Amazon, and for</i> <i><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>digital download</a> Dec. 20.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8ismJudnKGubr7OrKqepJyeu6p5wKelmmWSlr%2B6v8enoKSnpmLAtcXLnmScqqWotQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-handsmaid-tale-quotes.html><span>←</span><span>30 Best Quotes from The Handmaid's Tale TV Show on Hulu</span></a>
