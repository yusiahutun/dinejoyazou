<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Kevin Jonas Baby: Joe, Nick Jonas Congratulate Brother on Twitter</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Kevin Jonas</strong></a> isn't the only one who "can't wait" to meet his first child with wife <strong>Danielle</strong> — the singer's brothers <a href=#><strong>Joe</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a> are almost as thrilled as the dad-to-be himself. Both took to Twitter shortly after the July 9 <a href=#>baby announcement</a> to send their well-wishes to the Married to Jonas stars.</p><p>"Can't explain how excited I am about this. I'm going to be an uncle! Congrats @kevinjonas & @daniellejonas!!" Joe, 23, <a href=#>tweeted</a>. Later, he shared a funny picture of an ultrasound of a baby drinking from a Starbucks cup, captioning it, "So pumped to be an uncle."</p><p>Nick, meanwhile, <a href=#>wrote</a>: "Can't wait to welcome the newest addition of the Jonas family. Congratulations to my bro."</p><p>As <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> previously reported, Kevin announced on July 9 that he and his wife are expecting a baby later this year. "It's true — Danielle is pregnant! Can't even imagine how excited we are," the 25-year-old singer <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "I can't wait to share this with my best friend. I love you baby."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Danielle, for her part, opened up about the couple's quest to become parents last August. "We're just waiting for the right time, and to have enough time to spend with the child and not miss everything about them growing up," she said. "I think that's our biggest concern."</p><p>The Jonas Brothers — Kevin, Joe, and Nick — are currently working on their fifth studio album. They're also busy with a world tour, which kicked off in Mexico on June 1 and will end in Minnesota on Oct. 8.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajp5Vit7C6wKxkp6GToHqru82aqmabn6O0s63TrqOarJViuKbCyKdko6eelsBuw8ifnGackaO2prjLnmSopl2lv6azzZqlnLFdo7K4v4xrZ2prYWWEcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./giants-qb-tommy-devito-benching-loss-eagles-nfl-html.html><span>←</span><span>Giants QB Tommy DeVito says his benching during the loss to the Eagles was a 'reminder that it's a b</span></a>
