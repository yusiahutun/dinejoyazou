The thrusting element was what intrigued me about this vibrator, and although a little noisy, they definitely added a new element to the standard rabbit vibe! It’s a pretty substantial size and weight, and the thrusting makes it perfect if you’re looking for G-spot stimulation as well as clitoral. Overall, if you’re looking for a thrusting vibrator – Happy Rabbit will not disappoint.”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Dame Fin Vibrator For Fingers</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>best finger vibrator</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/dame.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Dame, $55</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>3-speed vibration</li><li>Can be worn multiple ways</li><li>USB chargeable</li></ul><p>This&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">finger vibrator</a></strong>&nbsp;is small but packs a punch!
