It was this platform that helped introduce Anthony's "Rich Men North of Richmond" to a global platform, with his performance video of the song racking up nearly 27 million views and landing at the No. 1 spot on YouTube's Trending page for music as of Sunday (Aug. 20.)</p><p>With that level of viral success, Riffe says that record labels and agents are swarming to sign Anthony, but the singer and his team are "taking it slow" as they make decisions about who to work with. Last week, in a Facebook post, Anthony <a href=#>claimed he has turned down </a>"8 million dollar offers," explaining, "I don't want 6 tour buses, 15 tractor trailers and a jet. I don't want to play stadium shows, I don't want to be in the spotlight."</p><p>Riffe, who is also a musician and hails from West Virginia, says he began supporting Anthony simply because he felt such a strong connection to it.</p><p>"I listened to Oliver's music and I just knew he was special. Normally, it's 'OK, this person has a good song and I want to help them out and get them on the channel.' With Oliver, I called my friends and family on my way to record him and also on my way back to tell them how special [he was.]"</p><p>Riffe says he and Anthony "prayed before the session" when they recorded "Rich Men North of Richmond." "We just felt like it was for a purpose that was way bigger than us, just two old regular dudes, you know what I mean?" he recounts.</p><p>"In our opinion, God has chosen to speak through Oliver and to speak to all Americans through his music, all around the world," Riffe continues. "We've gotten comments from Zimbabwe, every country you could think of."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>50 Great Modern Traditional Country Songs, with Artists</h2><p>There's some great traditional country music&nbsp;out there, but you may need to hunt for it.
