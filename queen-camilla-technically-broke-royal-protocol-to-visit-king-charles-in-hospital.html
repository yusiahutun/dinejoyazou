Usually, a member of The Firm will arrive at the hospital for operations alone.</p><p>Levine said: “I think it’s very touching that Camilla’s ignored all the protocol that you don’t go with your husband if he’s a king, or you’re a queen.</p><p>“[She] has been to visit him several times. Three times on the first day, two on the Saturday, and yesterday twice as well.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>King Charles’ heartbreaking confession about ‘never wanting the throne sooner’</a></p><p>“So she wants to sit there and be with him.”</p><p>Charles has now been released from hospital. Buckingham Palace released a statement in which he thanked the staff who had treated him.</p><p>“The King was this afternoon discharged from hospital following planned medical treatment and has rescheduled forthcoming public engagements to allow for a period of private recuperation,” the statement read. “His Majesty would like to thank the medical team and all those involved in supporting his hospital visit, and is grateful for all the kind messages he has received in recent days.”</p><p>They had previously said his condition was “benign” and his public duties were being postponed so he could recover.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-middleton-underwent-planned-surgery-as-well>Kate Middleton underwent ‘planned’ surgery as well</h2><p>Kensington Palace <a href=#>revealed Kate would have an operation</a> on the same day her father-in-law did. Though it was disclosed she was having “abdominal” surgery (also at The London Clinic), she did not publically reveal the specifics. Kate has now been released from hospital, Prince William is probably taking good care of his wife.</p><p>The Palace said she would be resting and wouldn’t return to official duties until at least Easter.</p><p>They said: “She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible; and her wish that her personal medical information remains private.</p><p>“Kensington Palace will, therefore, only provide updates on Her Royal Highness’ progress when there is significant new information to share.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Prince William tries ‘desperately hard’ not to think about his destiny on the throne</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2h%2BcL3UnpynZZOWuqq4y5pkrZ2Tnbuqr8Clo7Jlkqe8rLGMq6aymZxivbO706iaqKRdqbxuwsisoK1lm567qHnCoZirpJWoeqq6jKGmrKiZqa6tew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./newjeans-sing-riot-games-new-league-of-legends-anthem.html><span>←</span><span>NewJeans Sing Riot Games New League Of Legends Anthem</span></a>
