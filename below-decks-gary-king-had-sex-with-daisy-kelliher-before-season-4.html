Now you can’t have me and now you f—king want me?” she asked in the sneak peek, seemingly referring to <a href=#>her season 3 makeout session with the first officer</a> in the hot tub.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Below-Deck-Sailing-Yacht-s-Gary-King-Reveals-He-Had-F%E2%80%94king-Amazing-Sex-With-Daisy-Kelliher-Amid-Colin-Macrae-Love-Triangle-You-Didn-t-Want-Me-276.jpg><p>Gary, however, dropped a major bombshell w<a href=#>hen he admitted that the twosome got closer</a> off screen, saying, “Having sex with you was f—king amazing.” In response, Daisy tried to get the New Zealand native to stop talking as she realized cameras captured the comment.</p><p>Later in the clip, Colin reacted in shock at the news of Daisy and Gary’s past. “The chemistry that they have and the way they look at each other — I thought it was all friends. It all makes sense now,” the engineer said in a confessional.</p><p>Amid the unexpected love triangle, the chief stew put Gary and Colin on blast <a href=#>for leaving her confused about her feelings</a>. “There’s two of you in my head. Stop f—king with my head,” she told her costars. “I just want you both out of my f—king head.”</p><p>Daisy and Gary, who <a href=#>both joined the Below Deck spinoff</a> in 2021, first sparked romance rumors after they shared a steamy moment while filming season 3. Since then, Gary has <a href=#>expressed interest in potentially exploring a romance</a> with the Ireland native.</p><p>“I think if people watched season 2, they would realize I always had a soft spot for Daisy. I have always felt attracted to Daisy and it is quite weird speaking about this because she is sitting just over there,” he explained in June 2022 during a Below Deck reunion, which he filmed virtually in the same apartment as Daisy. “But I love Daisy. I love her as a person, I love her personality and I think she is a superstar and gorgeous at that.”</p><p>Daisy, for her part, questioned if Gary’s intentions <a href=#>were fueled by her season 4 connection with Colin.</a></p><p>“I definitely feel like he was jealous. I think the boys — at times it did feel like I was a trophy prize [for them]. I could be completely wrong but [the way they acted felt a] bit like an ego thing going on between the two of them,” she exclusively told Us Weekly in April about the love triangle. “And I was like, ‘OK, I don’t really want to be involved in this.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Below-Deck-Sailing-Yacht-s-Gary-King-Reveals-He-Had-F%E2%80%94king-Amazing-Sex-With-Daisy-Kelliher-Amid-Colin-Macrae-Love-Triangle-You-Didn-t-Want-Me-275.jpg><p>The reality star continued: “I don’t know what’s going on [there] but at times that’s kind of what it felt like. So definitely Gary was jealous, but was he jealous just because he wasn’t the guy who was picked or was he jealous because he actually liked me? That I can’t answer.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That same month, Gary <a href=#>hinted that he still had hope</a> for him and Daisy. “I speak to Daisy quite a lot and the problem is we are always so far away from each other. Our lives are in very different stages at the moment, but I’m definitely keeping that door open,” he shared with Us. “You never know what could happen. I won’t say that it’s not gonna happen. There is definitely chemistry between us so I’m quite excited to see what the future holds.”</p><p>Below Deck Sailing Yacht airs on Bravo Mondays at 8 p.m. Back to back episodes will begin airing on Monday, June 12 at 8 p.m.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmepJ%2BseqWxwqSqZp%2BRp8Zut8innmagkZl6tLHXZq6irJhisaK10rJkpJ2cobapsdFmmZ6en6eybr%2FEmqqopl1pfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meghan-markle-eyebrow-change.html><span>←</span><span>Meghan Markle made a major change to her face did you spot it?</span></a>
