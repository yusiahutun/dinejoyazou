In the following days, Fred complained about Josie's cooking skills and tried to offer her advice.</p><p id=eLkvVeSUrpc data-wc=60>In an episode that aired earlier this week, Fred shared his frustrations over Josie's approach. "<strong>There is no method, there is no technique,</strong>" he said in the Bush Telegraph. "She is just winging it and making it up as she goes along. It's better if I look away and stay away from the kitchen because it just drives me crazy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eec7e60a5bd9-fred-josie-im-a-celeb.jpg><p id=e-AtHupaq-x data-wc=64>Later on in the instalment, Josie's attempt to make bean fritters didn't go as planned – and Fred was less than impressed. Speaking in the Bush Telegraph again, he said: "She's got no eggs, she's got no flour, nothing but beans and oil. But I have stopped advising, I have stopped saying anything, I'm just going with the flow. Go on Josie, have fun."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eZQ2qvF8fJY data-wc=40>In Fred's post-exit interview on This Morning, Rylan asked what happened between the pair regarding the cooking duties.

"This morning, I spoke to my mum who called me because she knew I was out and she said to me, '<strong>Frederick, what did you do with Josie?</strong> Why were you standing over the top telling her what to do? What was going through your mind?' I got a telling-off from my mum," he explained.</p><p id=eP9DKF4SZP_ data-wc=27>"She said, 'Frederick, I don't want to listen to you, <strong>this is unacceptable, you can't do that&nbsp;</strong>and I don't want you to do it again today.'</p><p id=e9ZBdqAHbRf data-wc=12><strong>READ:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>How much money does the winner of I'm a Celebrity make?</a></p><p id=eNtlT638SuM data-wc=27>"She didn't understand that I was not in the jungle and I was out because of the way everything is edited.
