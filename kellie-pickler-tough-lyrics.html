"Actually, I had no idea that she was going to do it," Pickler reveals to Taste of Country. "I just met Leslie not too long ago, and we sat down. We've written a little bit together. I was telling her a lot about my life and just some personal things that I've been through that I have not shared with anyone. She kind of took my story home and made 'Tough.' She took my life story and some things that I said and she said she locked herself in a room and wouldn't come out until she wrote Kellie's first single."</p><p>“I wanted lace / I wanted pearls / To be a princess like the other girls / But life came hard to my front door / And I grew up trying to even up the score,” Pickler sings in the lyrics of the opening verse of her newest single -- the first in over a year and the first from her forthcoming new record.</p><p>In this song, the North Carolinian persists that she won't adhere to what everyone else expects of her, because she's grown a thick shell as a result of her life hardships, and is going to maintain that toughness. "After I cut the song and recorded the song Leslie told me that, you know, she's written many songs, but she's only written songs specifically for three people," Pickler continues. "One was 'Troubadour' for <a href=#>George Strait</a>, and then she wrote a song specifically for <a href=#>Willie Nelson</a> that he recorded, and she said, 'And you, Miss Pickler.' I was like, 'Wow, I'm in good company!' I'm so honored and blessed. Leslie is such an amazing woman and and an amazing writer and singer. When she took my story and created 'Tough,' I thought, 'Wow, this is really, really great.' I love this song and what it's about, what it stands for."</p><p>'Tough' comes from a personal place in Pickler's heart, and she's eager to share her musical story with the world, in hopes that it might inspire others to pick up the pieces and hold their heads high.</p><p>"The whole premise behind the song -- the whole meaning behind the song -- is that, you know, you don't have a choice. You don't get to choose the place, the day that you're born," Pickler theorizes. "Life is going to deal you a hand of cards, and you don't have any control over what hand of cards it's gonna deal you, but you do have control over how you play the game. I know there's so many other young women and young girls and boys that have been brought into a non-stable environment, and have had a rocky, rough upbringing and hard times growing up. There's a lot of people out there like that, and I think they'll really identify with this song and what it's about and what it stands for. Hopefully, it empowers people to take control of their life and take control of where they're headed."</p><p><strong><a href=#>Listen to Kellie Pickler's 'Tough'</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2cobamec%2BimqSklad6tbvUoJ9mpKmntqS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chandra-janway.html><span>←</span><span>Chandra Janway</span></a>
