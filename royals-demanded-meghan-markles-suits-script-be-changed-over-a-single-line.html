Not many things, by the way, but a few things that we wanted to do and couldn’t do, and it was a little irritating.”</p><p>He explained: “I remember one was a particular line of dialogue and, look, I’ll just say what the line was. My wife’s family, when they have a topic to discuss that might be sensitive, they use the word, ‘poppycock.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1422753971-710x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-royal-family-did-not-want-her-saying-the-word>“The Royal Family did not want her saying the word”</h2><p>Korsh explained that the particular line of Meghan (Rachel) in the show was part of a scene where Rachel is talking about her family.</p><p>He added: “So, in the episode, Mike and Rachel were going to have a thing, and as a nod to my in-laws, we were going to have her say, ‘My family would say poppycock.’ And the royal family did not want her saying the word. They didn’t want to put the word ‘poppycock’ in her mouth.”</p><p>Ultimately, Rachel’s dialogue was changed, and she ended up saying ‘bull***t’ rather than ‘poppycock.’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-s-dating-life-and-the-timeline-of-suits>Meghan’s dating life and the timeline of Suits</h2><p>The Duchess of Sussex starred in Suits from 2011 to 2018 and she started dating <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> sometime in 2016. While Korsh is not sure about how the royal family got access to the scripts of Meghan’s show, he claimed: “I was aware that they were reading them because I got the feedback, but I don’t remember the process by which they got them.”</p><p>Korsh is clearly not happy about the situation as he added: “Whoever it was, they didn’t like having to tell me any more than I liked having to hear it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1465627488-1024x660.jpg><p><strong>ALSO READ:</strong> <a href=#>Fears Meghan Markle’s small sign is a ‘cry for help’ during ‘struggle’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2h9cL7Ospilq12Zsq6tzZ2cnWWdmrSprc1mpJqqm6GytHnSrqCtq12osLO1z61km51dmLWiusaem2anppq%2Fbq2MrKCnn5yaeq21zZ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dwts-5th-judge-mauricio-umansky-family-struggles-motown-night.html><span>←</span><span>Mauricio Umansky Family Struggles Hit Hard</span></a>
