While at first sight they could be mistaken for the tacky polyester ensembles in sex shops, look closer – each piece is rich with detail, secret clasps and closures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kuo founded the line after working for several ready-to-wear brands, including Nicopanda, Asher Levine and Profound Aesthetic, in both Taiwan and New York, which exposed her to the failings of the fashion industry and the degree of waste and pollution caused. She incorporated her affinity for Japanese manga – she used to draw the characters as a child – into her subsequent fashion career.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When she first conceived The End, she had already tapped into a burgeoning collective energy, one that did not shame sexuality. She says that her pieces are not just for naughty nights out – or in, as the case might be – but can also be incorporated into functional daywear: a saucy bra over a crisp white shirt, for example.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/23/97ee7b82-c295-4904-9b57-cbd6a66aa49b_aa29360c.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/23/7b135965-f490-497b-bc03-fcdd2adecfa9_3a6041ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sexiness is at the forefront, she says, adding that most people are far more sexual than they think.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company ships worldwide through its website – and Kuo says there are few limits to who could wear it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are all practising BDSM [bondage, dominance, submission and sadomasochism] on a certain level,” she says. “We just may not realise it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmptcWhpany1rciwmKedo5p6pbHSop6nnaKoerSx17JknpyXrnqttc2gnKuhlWLBsMHCoZysZZKZwK55wKeb</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-08a3d59c-b33e-11ee-b60a-7f3c5df5968e-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rebecca Leigh Lambert | Obituaries</span></a>
