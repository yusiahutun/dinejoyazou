Or, perhaps you're trying to sell your device, or <a href=#>get warranty service</a>. Or maybe you just want to download an over-the-air update. Whatever your reasons, unrooting isn't that difficult--as long as you know what you're doing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Rooting or Unlocking Void Your Android Phone's Warranty?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-many-ways-to-unroot-an-android-phone>The Many Ways to Unroot an Android Phone</h2><p>Like <a href=#>rooting</a>,&nbsp;there are a few different methods of unrooting your phone, and which one you'll use depends on your device, the version of Android you're running, and what you're trying to accomplish. In general, unrooting will involve one of these processes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Any Phone that has only been rooted</strong>: If all you've done is root your phone, and stuck with your phone's default version of Android, unrooting should (hopefully) be easy. You can unroot your phone using an option in the SuperSU app, which will remove root and replace Android's stock recovery. This is detailed in the first section of this guide.</li><li><strong>Any phone <a href=#>running a custom ROM</a> or using&nbsp;<a href=#>the Xposed Framework</a></strong>: If you've done more than root, you've likely altered certain parts of your system heavily enough that they only way to unroot is to return to a completely stock, out-of-the-factory condition. This is different for every phone, and we can't give instructions for each one, but we discuss it&nbsp;in the final section of this guide.</li></ul><p>Seems simple, right? Unfortunately, the SuperSU method doesn't always work perfectly. Maybe it fails, or maybe it can't replace your stock recovery for some reason. In those cases, you can manually unroot your phone using one of these methods:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Nexus and other Developer Edition Phones</strong> running <strong>Marshmallow</strong>:&nbsp;If the SuperSU method doesn't work, you can manually unroot your device by re-flashing its boot.img. This is the main file that gets edited when you root a phone with Marshmallow, so replacing it and&nbsp;then re-flashing Android's stock recovery should do the trick. This is discussed in the second section of this guide.</li><li><strong>Nexus and other Developer Edition Phones</strong> running <strong>Lollipop and Before</strong>:&nbsp;If the SuperSU method doesn't work,&nbsp;you can manually unroot your device by&nbsp;deleting the su binary. This is the file that gives you root access on pre-Marshmallow phones, so deleting it and then re-flashing Android's stock recovery should do the trick. This is discussed in the third section of this guide.</li><li><strong>Non-Developer Edition phones</strong>:&nbsp;If the SuperSU method doesn't work and you have a non-developer phone, you will likely have to go nuclear. That means wiping your phone and returning it to a completely stock, out-of-the-factory condition in order to unroot. This is different for every phone, and we can't give instructions for each one, but we discuss it&nbsp;in the final section of this guide.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We will cover each of these methods (in varying levels of detail) in the four sections below. So skip down to the section that fits your device, version of Android, and situation.</p><h2 id=how-to-unroot-basically-any-android-device-with-supersu>How to Unroot Basically Any Android Device with SuperSU</h2><p>SuperSU is easily the most popular and robust root management app available on Android.&nbsp;If you're running a rooted device, there's a very high chance that you're using SuperSU to manage which apps get superuser access. It's also the smartest and easiest way to quickly unroot your Android device, because the entire process is done within the app directly on the phone.</p><p>To fully unroot the device, the first thing you'll want to do is jump into the SuperSU app, which is found in the app drawer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screenshot_20160401-120706.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once opened, swipe over or tap the Settings tab and scroll towards the bottom till you see the "Cleanup" section. Tap the&nbsp;"Full unroot" option.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screenshot_20160331-143724.png><p>This will present a dialog box with what to expect from the unroot process and ask if you'd like to continue. If you're on a device with the traditional rooting method—generally Lollipop or older—then this is the first and only step for you. Hitting continue will unroot the device, and you'll need to reboot to finish the process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screenshot_20160331-144854.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're on a device that was rooted with the <a href=#>systemless root method</a> in Marshmallow, tapping the "Continue" option will open another dialog that asks if you'd like to restore the stock boot image, noting that this is required for OTA (over-the-air) updates. If you're hoping to download the latest Android update when it drops, or if you're getting rid of the device, then I would suggest tapping "Yes" here. If those options don't apply to your situation, it's probably fine to just leave the modified boot image by hitting "No."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screenshot_20160331-145220.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following screen may ask if you'd like to restore the stock recovery image. If you're running a custom recovery (which is likely) and you want to pull an OTA update, this option is necessary—tap "Yes" to continue. If you plan on re-rooting in the future or want to continue using your custom recovery (say, for <a href=#>nandroid backups</a>), then hit "No" here. There's a chance that this option may not show up, in which case you'll have to manually flash the stock recovery. There are instructions on how to do this&nbsp;in the manual section below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screenshot_20160331-145705.png><p>After that, SuperSU will remove itself and clean up the installation. The entire process will only take a few seconds, and then the device will reboot. Once it's finished, it should be completely unrooted and, depending on which options were selected during the unroot process, back in a completely stock form.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-manually-unroot-a-nexus-or-other-developer-device-on-marshmallow>How to Manually Unroot a Nexus or Other Developer Device on Marshmallow</h2><p>While the above&nbsp;method of unrooting with SuperSU <i>should</i> theoretically work just fine on devices that have been rooted using the <a href=#>systemless method</a>, it's still good to know what to do in a situation where SuperSU may not be able to fully unroot the device.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is "Systemless Root" on Android, and Why Is It Better?</a></span></p><p>The good news is that it's a simple flash—replacing the modified boot.img with the stock one--should do the trick.</p><p>I’m using a Nexus 5 for this example, but the process will be identical for all other Nexus devices.

This is also the only way to unroot a non-Nexus or Developer Edition phone if the SuperSU method doesn't work for you.</p><p>Unfortunately, the process is pretty different for every manufacturer, and can even vary from device to device. So, with the exception of Nexus devices (which we have a guide for), we can't detail all the instructions here. Instead, you'll have to poke around a site like the <a href=#>XDA Developers forum</a> for the full instructions for your phone. Here's a quick and dirty look&nbsp;of what the process entails for each manufacturer, though:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Nexus and other Developer Edition devices</strong>:&nbsp;Nexus devices are pretty easy.&nbsp;You just need to download a factory image&nbsp;from Google or your manufacturer (much like we did in the manual unrooting instructions for Marshmallow above), then flash all the files contained within to your phone. Check out <a href=#>our guide to manually flashing your Nexus</a> for the full instructions.</li><li><b>Samsung devices:</b>&nbsp;You'll need the full firmware file, which should be available for basically every device at <a href=#>Sammobile.com</a>. You'll be dealing with a program called "Odin" on the PC, which is fairly straightforward. Just make sure find a reliable guide for your exact device.</li><li><b>Motorola devices:</b>&nbsp;Motorola uses a program called "RSD Lite" to push image files to devices, though the company doesn't make its images available for non-developer devices. There are copies floating around out there, but make sure you're downloading from a trusted source before taking the plunge.</li><li><b>LG devices: </b>LG uses a purpose-built "Flash Tool" to push device-specific KDZ files to its phones. Again, this can be tricky, so make sure you're using a trusted source and guide.</li><li><b>HTC devices:</b>&nbsp;HTC could perhaps be the most flash-friendly of all the consumer devices, as it just uses what's called an "RUU" (ROM Update Utility) file that can be pushed with simple adb and fastboot commands. Alternatively, you can place the RUU on the /sdcard partition of most HTC devices and it'll be automatically detected once you boot into the bootloader. You just need to find the RUU for your specific phone.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We wish we could give details for every single phone out there, but it's just not possible--this is yet one more reason why we love Nexus and other Developer Edition devices. But with a bit of digging, you should be able to unroot just about any phone out there, and get it back to a good working state.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhpbXBmZoZwtM6wZK2nXaq7s7vOrWSyp6WneqK6w6umopxdpbWwusRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dota-2-e-sports-fans-receive-gift-malaysia-they-await-world-class.html><span>←</span><span>Dota 2: e-sports fans receive gift in Malaysia as they await world-class gamers at Kuala Lumpu</span></a>
