I am wearing their logo on my sports bra."</p><p>But there was also an "exciting" motivating factor for her. She continued: "I also kinda got excited about it because I feel like it’s chance for me - I’ve always been authentic on social media.</p><p>"But over the years with like the more spotlight that I get, especially with a fight like Baumgardner where I’m also getting an equal amount of hate, it was kind of exciting to me to maybe start on a platform where people are really really there because they support me, they’re my fans.</p><p><b><i>What fights are you most looking forward to this weekend? </i></b><b><i>Let us know in the <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>comments section</a> below</i></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29710743.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Screenshot-672.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29711165.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Screenshot-673.jpg><p>"No one’s gonna go subscribe to my channel for $10 a month to talk s*** or call me a horse face.
