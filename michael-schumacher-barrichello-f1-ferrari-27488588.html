One of the team-mates to suffer most from Schumacher’s superiority was Rubens Barrichello, who drove for Ferrari between 2000 and 2005, during the Italian marque’s domination of the sport.</p><p>Barrichello had the talent to be a champion himself but that was never likely to happen while Schumacher was in the same garage. The Brazilian’s place in the team was summed up when he reluctantly moved over on the final lap to allow Schumacher to win the Austrian Grand Prix in 2002.</p><p><b>READ NEXT: <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Disgraced F1 champion Nelson Piquet punched and kicked driver he mentored after crash</a></b></p><p>Tired of being a wingman, Barrichello made way for another Brazilian, Felipe Massa, at Ferrari at the end of the 2005 season, racing for Honda, who pulled out of the sport at the end of 2008.</p><p>The team was kept alive by Ross Brawn, one of Barrichello’s former bosses at Ferrari, and he battled Jenson Button for the title in 2009, with the Briton just taking the crown. When Brawn GP became Mercedes, Barrichello moved on to Williams before finally retiring from the sport at the end of 2011 after 322 grand prix starts.</p><p>Barrichello moved onto IndyCars for 2012, finishing a respectable 11th in the Indy 500.
