Gone are the stiff upbringings, the millions of nannies, and the effort to isolate kids from "commoners." Ever since <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>, the way royal offsprings are raised has been drastically modernized. Princess Diana famously forwent hiring a nanny when raising <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and <a href=#>Prince William</a>. And <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> does most of her own cooking for <a href=#>Prince George</a> and <a href=#>Princess Charlotte</a> instead of hiring a chef.</p><p>But that still doesn't mean royal kids have a "normal" upbringing by any means. After all, it's hard being "average" when there are parades in the city every time your grandmother has a birthday. But the pampered prince and princesses of the British monarchy have come a long way. <a href=#>Prince Charles</a>, for example, had a drastically different childhood from his grandson. Charles, <a href=#>reportedly</a>, only saw his mother <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth</a> about an hour a day and was mostly tended to by a nanny. At age 5, after being apart from his mother for six months while she was on tour, Queen Elizabeth greeted him with, not a hug, but a handshake.</p><p>However, the "old" rules of royalty are changing, and the new generation is putting an end to the stiffy isolationism of the old days. In fact, this rift of ideologies has been causing a bit of conflict within the family. “We are involved in modernizing the British monarchy," Harry told <a href=#>Newsweek</a>. "We are not doing this for ourselves but for the greater good of the people…. Is there any one of the royal family who wants to be king or queen? I don’t think so, but we will carry out our duties at the right time.” Many find it admirable that the royal family wants to move away from old, stuffy stereotypes, but many find it unrealistic that the monarchy will ever be seen as "normal." After all, royal kids still have unlimited access to ponies and the palace as their playground. Not really all that normal, right? <strong>Below, a look at what it's like being a modern royal child.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46loJ%2BdXaSzbq2Mq6aymZxiuKqwjGpscWpjbHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-riley-christian-and-maurissa-gunn-breakup-instagram-cleanse-of-couple-ph.html><span>←</span><span>BIP: Why Did Riley Christian And Maurissa Gunn Breakup?
