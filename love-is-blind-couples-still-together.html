Kwame—a sales development manager from Seattle—and Chelsea—a pediatric speech language pathologist from Seattle—were one of three couples who got married in the Love Is Blind Season 4 finale in May 2022, along with Tiffany Pennywell and Brett Brown; and Zack Goytowski and Bliss Poureetezadi.</p><p>Kwame and Chelsea are still together as of writing this. In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a> in September 2023, Kwame and Chelsea shared their future plans as a couple. “More life, more living, more experiences, family, traveling, memories,” Chelsea said. “Our goal this summer was just to focus on each other and enjoy our marriage, and I think we thoroughly fulfilled that goal and that we’ll continue that goal and add some cool things into the mix this next year.”</p><p>Kwame added, “In the words of the great poet Aubrey Graham, a.k.a. Drake, ‘More life, more love, more everything.’ Just living our lives in abundance, trying to create more, have more focus, make more money, everything that gives our life more opportunity.” He continued, “I love options. We love options, so we want to give ourselves as many options as we possibly can as we continue to move forward in this marriage journey,” he continues. “In that way, it helps us to know what we can do. Those options could be stay in Seattle or it could be move somewhere else, and all that comes with giving ourselves more options and more opportunities.”</p><p>Kwame and Chelsea also confirmed that they had discussed moving out of Seattle, where they first met. “Just willingness together,” she said. “If I was like, ‘Kwame, what about this place?’ Last year, he’d be like, ‘Absolutely not. We’re never moving there.’ And it’s been a beautiful journey, even just understanding one another and now he’s like, ‘Oh, we’ll consider it. Let’s talk more about it.'”</p><p>She continued, “It’s a different experience in where we’re at, understanding each other. I think obviously it takes a long time to get to know a human. I think a whole lifetime. But what we knew about one another when we got married, it’s just so much deeper now. So I think that is a great blessing and is a really good thing that we have going for us.”</p><p>Chelsea also recalled her firsts with Kwame after after filming on Love Is Blind Season 4 ended. “I remember for ‘After the Altar’ sending pictures and videos to a producer about all the holidays we got to do,” said Chelsea, revealing that she joined the casting team for Love Is Blind. “I remember being like, ‘It’s our first Halloween, it’s our first Thanksgiving, it’s our first Christmas, our first birthdays.’ It was just a series of these exciting moments that you don’t think about when you’re so focused in [the moment].”</p><p>She continued, “All these beautiful, wonderful memories and times for us to create together appeared in life and it was so fun. It was really, really cool to build traditions and go on trips and [learn] what does Christmas mean for us as a family and together? … It was just the everyday experiences together, living life with each other.”</p><p>Kwame added, “I concur. We went to two of our individual favorite artists concerts and really got to enjoy and something that the other person enjoys. We went to Alicia Keys for her, that’s one of her favorite artists. And then we went to Drake for me, he’s one of my favorite artists. And so yeah, moments of taking things that we individually love and collaborating and creating that beautiful unison within our loves.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfoby3sYyiqmaanJ67pXnCqKyppJWoerTAyKWjZqyfnLK1tMSrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-kind-cancer-kate-middleton.html><span>←</span><span>What Kind Of Cancer Does Kate Middleton Have?
