While I’ve personally become very comfortable with buying regular-length denim and slicing the bottoms with a pair of fabric shears, I get that not everyone is into the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">frayed hem</a> look. Additionally, not everyone has the budget or time to take their pants to a tailor who can preserve the original hem on their jeans.</p><p>You’ll always meet fashion people who swear by a certain style of jeans or only wear jeans from a particular brand, but even when you compare and contrast denim with other short-legged folks, the search for the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">best petite jeans</a> feels like a never-ending game of trial-and-error — after all, what works for one body type won’t necessarily work for another. (Though we always love to fantasize about a Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants moment.)</p><p>So, ahead — at the recommendation of fellow short fashion colleagues, friends, and shop reviewers — we present a list of our current favorite petite denim styles. This isn’t a perfect or complete list by any means, but we did aim to cover brands that offer denim styles in an array of washes, fits, stretch levels, and silhouettes that are specifically suited for those who are 5’4″ and under. These jeans are also designed to be worn straight off the racks with no tailoring needed.</p><p>But, before you embark on your denim search, I highly suggest you first find your inseam and keep it handy in your Notes app — this number will be immensely helpful when looking at the size and fit details of a product. To determine your inseam, grab your favorite pair of (non-drop crotch) pants and measure the distance between the crotch and bottom hem. For a true <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">petite style</a>, this likely won’t be any longer than 27″, although some brands like to think that 30″ is a petite cut — which, ahem, it’s not. (Most short folks I know have inseams in the 23″–26″ range.) With this inseam measurement, you’ll have the power to find jeans that’ll actually fit your bottom half; add an inch for a longer length or remove an inch for a high-water look. And be sure to flex the classic trick of searching for “cropped” or “ankle” length jeans at any retailer that offers those filters — y’know, the jeans that are cropped on taller folks but are full-length on petites. Consider this an easy hack to quickly sort the short stuff.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><p class="ez-toc-title ez-toc-toggle">Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11436792.png><p><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Pilcro The Skipper Seamed High-Rise Cropped Wide-Leg Jeans (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Pilcro The Skipper Seamed High-Rise Cropped Wide-Leg Jeans</a>, $140</strong><br>If you are looking for non-traditional, petite-friendly jeans, Anthropologie has quite a selection. The brand stocks plenty of fashion-forward styles like wide-leg paper bag denim, dramatic bootcuts, and colorful cropped jeans. You can find plenty of standard options as well from house brands like Pilcro and beloved denim labels like Joe’s Jeans and Good American.</p><p>Shop <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Anthropologie</a></strong></p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11279669.png><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Abercrombie & Fitch High Rise Skinny Jeans (opens in a new tab)" href=#><strong>Abercrombie & Fitch High Rise Skinny Jeans</strong></a><strong>, $89<br></strong>A&F specializes in size-inclusive denim, with styles available in sizes 23–37 in extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long lengths. No kidding! (You can read more about the brand’s much-adored denim rebrand in our review <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.) For petites, this is great news. For instance, this TikTok fave comes in both “Short” (25.5″) and “Extra Short” (23.5″). Writes one 5’1″ reviewer, “The material is durable and thick but has a little bit of stretch to it which is my perfect combo. It’s enough to make you feel sucked in but stretchy enough to not have that rigid, stiff feel. Extra short is my perfect length and shows the perfect amount of my ankle so it works great with booties and boots that go a little higher up on the leg.”</p><p>Shop <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Abercrombie & Fitch (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Abercrombie & Fitch</a></strong></p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i1.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11279640.png><p><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Everlane The Way-High Jean (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Everlane The Way-High Jean</a>, </strong><strong>$118</strong><strong> $81</strong><br>Everlane takes its jeans selection seriously — it even boasts a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="whole denim guide (opens in a new tab)" href=#>whole denim guide</a>.

Mary Whitlock, the VP of the fashion and lifestyle firm, dishes this J.Crew style is the one for her: “I am 4’11” and curvy, so I have a very hard time finding petite jeans and these&nbsp;are the only jeans that have fit me without needing to be tailored in all of my years on this planet.” Plus, the brand has an impressive filtering system where under the “Size & Fit” category, you can select “Petite,” or you can search by “Length” and select “Cropped” or “Ankle.”</p><p>Shop <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="J.Crew (opens in a new tab)" href=#>J.Crew</a></strong></p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11279715.png><p><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Madewell Petite Stovepipe Jeans (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Madewell</a></strong><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Madewell Petite Stovepipe Jeans (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Petite Stovepipe Jeans</a>, $138<br></strong>If you didn’t know that Madewell has a whole <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Petite Perfect Vintage Jean collection (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Petite Perfect Vintage Jean collection</a> (offering every kind of wash color imaginable), you do now.

For those who are on the shorter side, Frame even has a collection called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Le Pixie (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Le Pixie</a>, denim styles made for those 5’3″ and under.

Customers have their pick of a 25″ or 27″ inseam, which may contribute to this jean’s sell-out power. Currently ranking a 4.7 out of 5 stars from 1,350 reviews, the jeans have petite denim lovers saying things like, “These are the most comfortable jeans I’ve ever tried on, and I have tried soooo many designer brands. […] I am 5’2” and 112lbs and I got a size 26 with the shorter inseam which is perfect.

Plus, as a few reviewers have pointed out, it’s difficult finding rigid denim jeans in plus sizes, and this classic style had a celebrated comeback. Writes one reviewer: “The 100% cotton construction is excellent! They are very comfortable. It is difficult to find plus-sized jeans that are 100% cotton that also fit very well.
