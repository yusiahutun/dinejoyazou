Fans quickly picked up on it and took to the comments to notify the <a href=#>celebrity</a> she might want to watch her step.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-halle-berry-posts-a-picture-with-poop-at-her-feet-for-some-reason>Halle Berry posts a picture with poop at her feet for some reason</h2><p>In her latest <a href=#>Instagram</a> post, Halle can be seen in a sunny location sitting on a huge rock while wearing a black swimsuit. However, she’s not the easiest to see as the snap she is shadowed by another rock lodged in front of her.</p><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> star captioned the picture: “Couldn’t hide these rocks” and added a winking face emoji.</p><p>However, on the floor by the actress’ feet were some pretty dark and questionable shapes that look suspiciously like poop, and fans couldn’t help but feel a little squeezy at the sight. They asked the 57-year-old why she hadn’t left it out of frame, with one commenter calling the decision “disgusting.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Harry Potter movies ‘saved’ famous actor after heartbreaking divorce</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-question-halle-s-less-than-picturesque-location>Fans question Halle’s less-than-picturesque location</h2><p>“Literally nobody sees the 3 giant mounds of human s***???” one fan penned adding three poop emojis, “Seriously, why post that photo with the s*** in it?”</p><p>Another wrote: “Dope Pic, crop the [poop emoji] that’s right in front of you out of this pic tho !!”</p><p>A third said: “What kind of shit is that by your [feet emoji]?”</p><p>However, others questioned if it was feces at all.</p><p>One person commented: “Zoom in. That’s not feces. Looks more like clumps of dried seaweed or clumps of coral. If you look round the picture, there are others lying around.”</p><p>Another agreed: “Isn’t it seaweed? Pretty sure it is.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1353180642-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-halle-brushes-off-the-backlash>Halle brushes off the backlash</h2><p>Halle Berry spent time replying to fans comments about the poop and seemed to laugh off people’s alarm.</p><p>“Why not? It is what it is,” she replied to one person with several laughing emojis.</p><p>To another person, she said: “I’ma let nature be nature!” again with some laughing emojis.</p><p>“Good question,” she told a third, “I don’t know and didn’t care!!! Nature is where my heart lives!”</p><p>Sharing her theory whether it was actually poop, Halle Berry wrote: “I’ma say it was a wild animal [poop]. A human is not out there s****ing !!!! Just saying [open mouth emoji].”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth’s son calling him by his first name divides fans – ‘disrespectful’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aGcLTApaOeZZKav7PFjKmmrJ2jYravecuipaCdop6ybq7UrWSfmZ6oeqK%2BxGaboquXqsC1scNmmbJlkaO2rq3LZqeop6Bitq95wZqapJ%2BipMKvsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tessa-brooks.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Tessa Brooks Boyfriend?
