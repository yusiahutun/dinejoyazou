As such, Ching’s foundation in Chinese and Asian culture, as well as Kiwi tourism and know-how, make for canny insights for Asian travellers and members of the diaspora.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Following the rebound of tourism after the Covid-19 pandemic, China was the country’s fifth-largest market last year, according to Tourism New Zealand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From the nation’s largest city, Auckland, in the North Island, Waiheke Island is an obvious suggestion for visitors, says Ching. A 45-minute ferry ride across the Hauraki Gulf leads to pristine scenery with beaches, vineyards and superb restaurants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whale- and dolphin-watching cruises around Auckland Harbour are another obvious attraction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But it’s from the vantage points of the country’s unique lodges that Ching urges travellers to explore.</p>I had to be completely naked in the video, set at Sydney’s Whale Beach. You just don’t think about it, but I was terribly nervous. He’d been my childhood idol forever.Geeling Ching on filming the music video for David Bowie’s ‘China Girl’<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Top of her list is seven-hectare Huka Lodge (which will be closed between April 30 and December 1 for refurbishment) on the banks of North Island’s Waikato River, upstream from the dramatic Huka Falls, in Taupo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip stayed here, New Zealand’s oldest lodge, four times, such was the appeal of its riverside rolling lawns and manicured gardens.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To the north, in the Bay of Islands, Ching singles out the Rosewood Kauri Cliffs lodge, with its championship golf course, and The Landing – a 400-hectare heritage and conservation property set in regenerated native forest and wetlands on the Purerua Peninsula.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of New Zealand’s earliest sites of Māori settlement, The Landing was developed together with local tribes, or iwi, and sites of cultural and heritage importance lie on the property, which is held in a charitable trust to ensure preservation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Bay of Islands (all 140 of them), nearly four hours’ drive from Auckland, is a recommended destination in itself. It is the birthplace of the country’s founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi, an 1840 agreement between the British crown and the local Māori.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/28/1d4668a1-eb07-4715-8e7e-9a0467e191af_77e70e99.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Surrounded by the aqua and cerulean Pacific Ocean, the region is a subtropical paradise renowned for deep-sea fishing, water sports, beaches, hiking and native vegetation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Go right to the northernmost tip – Cape Reinga. That’s where the [Tasman Sea] and Pacific oceans crash together,” says Ching.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Steeped in Māori tradition, the Te Paki Coastal Track leads to the cape’s lighthouse. Legend has it that people’s spirits depart from the windswept Cape Reinga – known to Māori as Te Rerenga Wairua; “the leaping place of the spirits” – when they die, bound for the Māori ancestral home of Hawaiki.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the North Island’s east coast, Hawke’s Bay, a premium wine-growing area, is a must, says Ching.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s easy to get around. We have hired e-bikes, toured, done wine tastings.

Apart from its unspoilt alpine scenery, the adventure capital of New Zealand offers bungee jumping, paragliding, jet boating on white water rapids, golf, scenic walks and cycling, and is one of the most renowned wine regions in the world.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another of Ching’s suggestions is to hire a car and drive to “one of the best spots on Earth”: Wānaka, an alpine town near Otago set in a snowcapped mountain and turquoise lake wonderland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If skiing, take the gentle slopes: “You want to go to Cardrona [Alpine Resort], where there’s a champagne bar halfway up the mountain.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/28/03e457e8-47ba-4866-8235-e8ef6b0c0149_edaccfec.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/28/332b4235-e688-477d-a85e-c0f2908594b6_798e21ed.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nearby, drop in to Arrowtown, where a heritage-listed Chinese settlement was founded during the 1860s gold rush.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What’s left in the historic Chinese settlement is a mixture of ruins, reconstructions and restorations. Almost entirely male, Arrowtown’s mainly Cantonese population reached about 5,000 in 1881, but a discriminatory poll tax introduced that year discouraged immigration.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Few made enough money to return home and most died there, not that you’ll find their graves in Arrowtown’s cemetery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We have not touched on the capital, Wellington – “that giant wind tunnel” – but if we stick to Ching’s recommendations, both islands can be covered in a couple of weeks, she reckons, although the North Island is best in summer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For serious foodies, she recommends central Auckland’s high-end Chinese restaurant Huami (meaning “nectar”). “Wealthy Chinese who live here take guests and Huami is attached to the SkyCity Casino, so it attracts high rollers.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/28/bdb0183f-a5ca-4dff-a856-049996161876_a8dbbb78.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Grand Harbour restaurant, in the Viaduct area, is famous for its Hong Kong specialities and yum cha, and Pearl Garden, in Auckland’s Newmarket, for classic Cantonese yum cha.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And remember Southland’s world-famous Bluff oysters, best eaten between March and August, says Ching.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The creamy shellfish can be found on menus throughout New Zealand, but perhaps Southland’s annual Bluff Oyster and Food Festival, in May, is the most appropriate setting in which to savour them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/28/719cc5a6-bcf6-4e96-96e9-e718c5f66c91_2a48f19f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Japanese and Korean restaurants are dotted all over Auckland: from sushi trains to luxe restaurants at the Sky Tower boasting 360-degree city views.
