However, she eventually gives Elsa a pair of pants and even crops her dress into a modified top.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1883-Elsa-blue-dress.jpg><p id=par-4_39>Jaros’ role in 1883 is far from her first acting credit. Her past experience proved helpful while trying to adopt Alina’s accent, which according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a> is “a blend of Eastern European, Romanian and Slovakian.”</p><p id=par-5_33>“Luckily I played a Czech immigrant in My America, which is close,” the actor told the outlet. “My dad’s side of the family is Czech so I thought I could get it.”</p><h2>Jaros was exhausted from performing her own stunts</h2><p id=par-6_43>Jaros may have been ready to put on her best accent, but it seems she didn’t realize just how grueling the filming conditions would be. “We shot in Texas and Montana in just crazy conditions,” the actor told The New York Post.</p><p id=par-7_46>“Winds so strong that some of the cast and crew tents went flying. Freezing cold temperatures, sweltering heat. One stunt double got hypothermia in the cold waters we were immersed in episode four.

Eventually, my body just gave out. I had to tell production, ‘If we’re doing more takes of me running up that hill for a mile, I’m going to need a vehicle to transport me.’”</p><h2>Jaros teases what’s next for Alina</h2><p id=par-10_59>Fans haven’t seen much of Alina in 1883 since she traded with Elsa. However, Jaros teased that Alina will likely have more of a story than just helping Elsa get a new outfit. “Without getting too specific, Alina is one of the Eastern European immigrants that helps Elsa transition into becoming more like a cowboy,” Jaros told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Express.co.uk</a>.</p><p id=par-11_27>“She might very well be the wittiest immigrant on the wagon train and there are definitely some more surprises in store for her as everyone’s journey unfolds.”</p><p id=par-12_6>New episodes of&nbsp;1883&nbsp;release Sundays on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGR%2BeYSSZpiloZ6WeqKv06ipZpmdlrulrYyjmKuno2LAosXSZpmonKlit7a%2F02aemq6VYr2mvsWoqaahnpx6tMDUp6usZpipuq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./480463-airyn-ruiz-bell-what-art-bells-wife.html><span>←</span><span>7 facts about Airyn Ruiz Bell - What you should know about Art Bell's wife</span></a>
