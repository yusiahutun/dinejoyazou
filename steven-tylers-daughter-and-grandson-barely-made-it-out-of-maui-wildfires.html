I don’t need to tell you what happened next.</p><p>“All I can say is, it was way worse than what you saw on the news and online,” she continued. “Many people and animals have lost their lives. Homes destroyed. Sacred buildings burnt to ashes. Thousand of locals and tourists displaced. And the horrors those people had to see and experience.</p><p>“Trying to keep my family and friends safe was all I could do. We were in a sacred paradise and could do nothing,” the Rush Hour star continued.</p><p>She then urged others not to travel to the destination, as she penned: &nbsp;“PLEASE DO NOT TRAVEL TO MAUI, as the hotels are helping to home the people of Maui. The island needs to heal and does not need tourists taking up valuable resources right now,” as the daughter of the <a href=#>music</a> star asked her followers to help by donating to the cause.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Celebrities are stepping up to help rebuild Maui</h2><p>People and <a href=#>celebrity</a> faces around the globe are coming together to help all those affected in Maui, including Jeff Bezos and his fiance Lauren Sanchez, who pledged $100 million to help rebuild the island.</p><p>Taking to Instagram, Lauren said herself and Jeff were ‘heartbroken’ by what’s happening. In part of her statement, the journalist wrote:</p><p>“We are thinking of the celebrities that have lost so much and a community that has been left devastated. The immediate needs are important, and so is the longer-term rebuilding that will have to happen – even after much of the attention has subsided.”</p><p>Dwayne Johnson also took to his social media to say he was “completely heartbroken” over the devastation. He then thanked everyone around the world for their love and prayers.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star took to his caption to thank the ‘local heros’ as he wrote: “Heartbroken but our faith and mana is strong.</p><p>“First responders, health care teams, hotels, locals businesses, boots-on-the-ground organizations and all our local heroes, stay strong – we love you and appreciate you.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2aBcL%2FTnq2epl2pxq2x0axknZmlnLW1sdFmmKecXZy%2ForrDrKanZZKWv6a42GakmpyVYra1ec6uq2anlmK6osHIZq6ipJSbtrOx0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shut-it-down-by-drake-lyrics-and-hidden-meaning.html><span>←</span><span>Shut it down by Drake - lyrics and hidden meaning</span></a>
