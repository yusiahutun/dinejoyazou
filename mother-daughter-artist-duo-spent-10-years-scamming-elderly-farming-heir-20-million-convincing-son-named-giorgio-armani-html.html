that Porsha was his wife and that they had together produced a young son named Giorgio Armani.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The decade-long scheme allegedly saw the fortune of Ralph Raines Jr., 67 - the sole heir to Raines Tree Farm, which had been in his family for three generations - liquidated of $20 million, leaving him with just $200,000.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The mother-daughter team used the proceeds to go on high-flying trips to Las Vegas, buy expensive cars - a convertible Ferrari with 'MRBIG' plates and a 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air convertible - as well as several properties, according to <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Oregon Live</a>.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The intricate conspiracy began in 2004 when Raines traveled from his family's&nbsp;1,300-acre tree farm in Gaston to Bend for a farming conference.</span></p><img id=i-d23cb92af6f6d4b2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/09/2486918C00000578-2902709-image-m-4_1420767138845.jpg height=414

a local psychic business, and allegedly cottoned on to the wealth that Raines commanded.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Lee kept in close touch with Raines and, in 2006, Raines hired her as a caretaker for his father, Ralph Sr., who had suffered a stroke, according to a feature in <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Willamette Week</a>.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Court records claim Lee was soon in charge of the family's finances.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Later that year, Raines bought a $915,000 house in Portland, to which Lee's family moved.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The scam took a major turn in 2008 when Lee introduced her daughter into her plannings.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Porsha Lee - then 17 - put on a blonde wig, heavy makeup and faked a British accent, and was introduced to Raines as a&nbsp;as Mary Marks, a UK resident who needed a

Samantha.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Somehow, Porsha managed to brainwash Raines into believing they were married.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>During this time Lee had established joint bank accounts for her daughter and her husband and was allegedly extorting money into accounts of her own.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The plot took another turn in 2011 when Ralph Raines Sr. died, with Rachel and Porsha Lee handling his $5 million estate.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Rachel Lee went on to convince Raines to sell the family farm for $12.3 million, saying that he needed money for inheritance taxes.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>As the sale went through, Lee and boyfriend, Blancey Lee, bought themselves luxury cars - a $200,000 Ferrari convertible and a $300,000 Bentley Mulsanne - went on a gambling trip to Vegas, bought properties they used as rentals and opened four psychic shops.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Last year, Lee allegedly kept her conspiracy going by convincing Raines he was bankrupt and getting to sell up the remainder the properties in his name.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>However it all came crashing down when an anonymous source notified police of suspicions they had over what was happening to Raines.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The&nbsp;Internal Revenue Service were then pulled into it and started building a case.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Federal agents arrested Rachel Lee
