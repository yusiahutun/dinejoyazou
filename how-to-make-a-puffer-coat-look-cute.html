In addition to being available in a sea of colors, there's also a vast array of materials like leather, shearling, and satin, to say nothing of the cuts, which can range from oversized to fitted, cropped to maxi, vested to belted, and everything in between (did we even mention the patterns?). With so many styles to choose from, there are plenty of ways to wear a puffer that ensure it doesn't take away from your overall outfit and, in many cases, actually enhances it. All you need is a bit of style inspiration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, we've compiled 14 puffer jacket outfit ideas that are sure to keep you warm&nbsp;and&nbsp;stylish.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-seek-an-oversized-bomber></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Seek an Oversized Bomber</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's more than one style of puffer jacket, and a puffy&nbsp;bomber&nbsp;— especially an oversized one — can instantly upgrade a polished trouser look. A monochromatic trouser look accented with a belt and crisp white sneakers is a great way to start and creates the perfect balance of tailored and relaxed.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-try-it-as-a-scarf></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Try It as a Scarf</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're not ready to take on the full coat, a puffer scarf is the best way to dip your toe into the trend. Of course it can go sporty, but it's an especially great way to bring the puffer coat look into your work dressing, working equally well with blazers, suits, and button downs.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-a-crop-top></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With a Crop Top</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is the style for you if you tend to run hot. As with many puffer coat looks, keeping your midriff-baring ensemble monochromatic is a great way in, as is sticking to knitwear and other luxe-feeling fabrics like satin, silk, or cashmere.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-full-on-maxi></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Full-On Maxi</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A floor length puffer offers extra warmth and coverage but also creates a cohesive look with a well-coordinated maxi-dress, making if officially work-wear appropriate. A matching knit hat,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>knee-high boots</a>, and a compact handbag keep the look chic and buttoned up. A dress with a fuller skirt gives the look a nice silhouette.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-make-it-monochromatic></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Make It Monochromatic</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A fun and easy idea? Coordinating your puffer coat with the outfit you're wearing underneath. Whether vibrant or neutral, don't worry about making it a perfect match — different shades within the same color family works, too. To really finish off the look, get your accessories in on the action, and keep shoes, scarves, and purses in the color family as well.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-go-for-florals></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Go for Florals</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wearing all black is an easy get-ready-quick trick, but if you're craving something a bit bolder, try a floral puffer coat. Even if you're not into a full-blown floral look, you can easily add a bright spot to your outfit by pulling complementary tones from the florals. Pairing your puffer with pastel loafers or colorful Wellies on a rainy day will provide instant lift.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-embrace-the-poof></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Embrace the Poof</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A big coat worn with other oversized pieces like baggy pants may seem counterintuitive, but working with a mix of textures gives a look dimension and interest. Consider working within one color palette with varying scales of pattern or texture, or go for a contrasting color blocking effect with a bright oversized hoodie or sweater. Even your footwear can be taken into account, with oversized clogs, platform boots, and lug-sole loafers all making great accessories.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pair-it-with-pleats></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pair It with Pleats</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Kirstin Sinclair/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A solid color puffer just calls out for texture, and pleats are an especially great match that instantly elevate the coat. Whether you go for a dress, skirt, or pants, look for bottoms with clearly defined textural contrasts like pleats, oversized stitching, velvet, patchwork, or even shearling. This is an especially powerful combo in an all-black look that screams chic.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-try-a-shrunken-vest></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Try a Shrunken Vest</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To ensure your puffer doesn't distract from your favorite 'fit or a beloved pair of trousers, consider a vest. You'll still achieve warmth and style but can experiment with suede cargo-slacks and accessories like scarves, hats, and even long gloves.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-embrace-patterns></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Embrace Patterns</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's no reason a puffer can't be just as colorful, elegant, or lively as any other piece in your wardrobe, and with styles now available in multiple materials and patterns, there's never been a better time to shop outside the box. Keeping the rest of your ensemble minimal will turn your puffer into a true statement piece.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-put-it-in-sports-mode></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Put It in Sports Mode</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's more to athleisure than just leggings (although those work, too!), and a puffer coat can be the cherry on top of a sporty or athletic look. Swap in oversized sweatpants and cargo pants, or even wide-leg pants, along with a jersey, sweatshirt, and your favorite sneakers, and top with a brightly colored puffer jacket or vest for a modern collegiate look.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ease-into-a-robe-style></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ease Into a Robe Style</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps one of the chicest (and coziest!) puffer coats is the robe, which borrows its shape from the classic belted wool coat but keeps the warmth and relaxed comfort of the puffer. It can instantly upgrade a more casual look or bring an effortless ease to a suit. If you're looking to really make a statement, seek out a style in a colorful pattern or go minimal in a solid.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-go-retro></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Go Retro</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The shrunken puffers of the '70s and '80s had another resurgence in the '90s (thank you,&nbsp;dELiA!). Like all things of that decade, these shrunken jackets are back again. The fitted silhouette works well with high-waisted pants and gives the full&nbsp;Alloy-catalog effect if paired with brightly colored corduroys and a micro-backpack. Consider thick-soled boots and chunky sneakers to be the ensemble's missing piece.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-match-it-with-a-mini></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Match It with a Mini</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether your look leans preppy, boho, or punk, a mini is a must, and a maxi puffer can keep you warm&nbsp;and&nbsp;balance out your mini-skirt look. Seek out a style that can stand out in a unique color or texture, and consider pairing it with footwear that covers up a little bit of leg, like knee-high boots.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2S1sMOMraZmpZGgsm6tjKmsn56Vp3qku8CtZKWnn6B6pMHTng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./philippines-has-7000-islands-so-why-it-not-attracting-more.html><span>←</span><span>The Philippines has 7,000 islands.
