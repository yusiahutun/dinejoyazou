Jim has amassed a considerable fortune through comedy and has established himself as a popular and respected comedian of our time.</p><p>We take you on a tour of the comedian’s world, including his love life and what his paycheck looks like</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jim Jefferies Brief Bio</strong></h2><p>Jim Jefferies was born on 14 February 1977 as Geoff James Nugent. Jim, who was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, is an Australian citizen of Irish descent. He was not born with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth, his father worked as a carpenter and his mother had a job as a substitute teacher.</p><p>Jim, the Australian actor, writer, stand-up comedian, and political commentator, spent his childhood in Sydney. He studied classical music and theatre at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts in Perth. Although he did not complete the course, he was not deterred by it in any way. Instead, he started his own stand-up comedy on a small scale and continued to perform. Before moving to Los Angeles, he had already made a name for himself in Australia, where he began his career in stand-up comedy. Originally he took the stage name Jim Jeffries but decided to change it to Jim Jefferies to avoid confusion when another American actor with the same name arrived.</p><p>Jim starred in an Australian low-budget film called Me and My Mates vs the Zombie Apocalypse in February 2014, which starred him along with a number of other Australian comedians – Greg Fleet and Alex Williamson. The film premiered in Australian cinemas on 25 July 2015. Later in 2015, it was released on DVD in New Zealand and Australia, and on 2 May 2016, it was released in the UK and Ireland. The film was released in the United States of America on July 5, 2016.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>WWE Roman Reigns Height, Weight, WWE Career, Suspension, Injury, House</a></strong></p><p>Jim’s first international recognition came by chance when he suffered an attack on stage during an appearance at the Manchester Comedy Store. This attack acted as a catalyst for his rise to fame, as footage of the incident was incorporated into his comedy number. His DVD Contraband, released in 2008, tells the story of this attack.</p><p>Jim Jefferies became a hit in the United States when he appeared in a popular stand-up special on HBO. He has subsequently performed at various festivals, including the South African Comedy Festival in Cape Town, the Glastonbury Festival, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, etc. The acclaimed comedian can look back on a number of television programs including Never Mind the Buzzcocks, Out of 10 Cats, and The Heaven and Earth Show. Jim is known to have attended the Opie and Anthony Show as a guest. He is currently starring in a new comedy series Legit on FX.</p><p>The Jim Jefferies Show became known to the public on March 3, 2017, through an announcement by Comedy Central. The show is a new series that will be shown in ten episodes in one week and will take a look at culture and politics. It debuts on June 6, 2017, and will be hosted by Jim Jefferies himself, who travels the world constantly to address the week’s top stories and controversial topics.</p><p>The first season of the Jim Jefferies Show was expanded by ten additional shows on July 25, 2017, and the broadcast of the debut season was completed on November 21, 2017. Comedy Central extended the series for the second season, increasing it from ten to twenty episodes on January 15, 2018, with the start of the second season scheduled for March 27, 2018.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The fact that a veteran comedian like Jim has never been honored with a prestigious award is always a surprise for his fans. Despite his commercial success, the Australian comedian still has a lot to accomplish, and we believe his best is yet to come. Jim’s net worth is estimated at $5.5 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jim Jefferies Family: Wife, Girlfriend, Son, Parents</strong></h2><p>Jim came from humble beginnings; with a father who is a cabinetmaker and a mother who is a substitute teacher, his beginnings would be difficult. Currently, Jim is still single but had a long affair with the Canadian actress Kate Luyben in the past. Their relationship, which began in January 2013, lasted for years and they have a child of love, a son named Hanks, who they can show for their years together as a couple. Hanks was born in November 2012.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Gelila Bekele Son, Age, Bio, Net Worth, Husband, Parents, And Tyler Perry</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jim Jefferies Religion</strong></h2><p>The Australian comedian considers himself an atheist. He doesn’t believe in any religion, nor does he believe that God is real. They say his atheism has intensified his comic acts and made them more comical.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kt6q5jKOcn56Vp7amv4ywoJ%2BdXZy2s7jFq6CeppRiwLC6jKmYq52eqcBussCmoKWxXaOytXnWqKmtoF2nsq21xqKmp2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-react-native-video-editor-sdks.html><span>←</span><span>5 Top React Native Video Editor SDKs</span></a>
