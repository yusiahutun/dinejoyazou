While she initially planned to address the situation on her own, Will joined the conversation, without being asked.</p><p>"We wanted to say that divorce wasn't an option and that family would remain our top priority," she explained of their plan for the episode. However, she felt midway though the taping that Will "seemed to convey that he had been done wrong" and made it appear like she kept the relationship with Alsina a secret, which she said wasn't the case. While she admitted she should have stopped the conversation in that moment, she "stalled my own voice" and kept going.</p><p>"Because I didn't want to oppose Will publicly, in my codependent way, I took the blame and played the pleasing and appeasing role I knew so well," she wrote, adding that she still went ahead with posting the episode despite being told by others it made it seem like she was in the wrong. In retrospect, she wrote that, "Neither Will nor I, in all our splendid dysfunction, was at all equipped for that conversation at the time. We were a classic comedic mess."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:18114c7e-292c-4b6c-973a-8b251673a8a4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:7737bd58-e1a2-4b3a-818d-ed03525b360a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/10/5by4/2023/10/11/1034cb89c09f44e086db8a4cab37dd64_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jada Pinkett Says Time Living Apart from Will Smith 'Coming to an End' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"You know, that was a big moment for me. It was a big healing moment, because I hadn't recognized that wounded-ness in myself that also created a dynamic between Will and I," Jada told TooFab ahead of the book's release. "As painful as that moment was, I'm so grateful. My mother kept telling me, 'You're codependent as hell. You need to get into some therapy.' And it wasn't till that moment that I was like, 'Oh, she is right.'"</p><p>She said that acknowledging that revelation and subsequent work on herself has sparked new conversations with Will, from whom she remains separated but still married.</p><p>"I think with everything that has happened in the last couple of years, we have been in such deep, beautiful, deep healing. Together and individually," she told TooFab. "Because your trauma will hide in these pockets of you thinking you’re doing one thing, but you're actually doing something else. You think you're helping something, but you're actually deteriorating something."</p><p>"And so, really walking together through some of these really tough moments that have happened, publicly and not publicly and getting a deeper understanding," she added, "It has just been really really beautifully amazing."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5346a11a-d449-40d5-9cdb-f683f0abd5a4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:7737bd58-e1a2-4b3a-818d-ed03525b360a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4e/5by4/2021/11/09/4ef60f5a3da44860b1e38588f901e278_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Why Jada Pinkett Smith Turned Down Tupac Proposal, How She Keeps His Memory Alive with Kids (Exclusive Details)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In the book, Jada revealed she and Will reached a state of "irreconcilable differences" in their marriage, but were steadfast in their promise to one another before they married that they would never get divorced. Instead, they decided to separate every way except legally, with Jada saying they were honest with their children, but not the public.</p><p>As far as "entanglements" are concerned, Jada said she didn't consider them affairs, since nobody was cheating. "In terms of Will and me, there were no secrets, so there was no affair," she added, clarifying that her situation with Alsina simply "ran its course" after a period of being romantic.</p><p>Jada's book, Worthy, is available Tuesday, October 17.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:59e87f71-1e72-418b-98dd-242e0061e130 data-container-ref=toofab:article:7737bd58-e1a2-4b3a-818d-ed03525b360a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/14/5by4/2023/10/16/14490dff473643b4ab27f6352e95b3fb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jada Pinkett Smith Details Hitting 'Rock Bottom,' Using Ayahuasca During Recovery 'Journey' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmam5fn66lrYypoKejlanBbr%2FMoquhZaeeua150qagraBdp7KledOamaWdXamurbeMnqWtmZ6cuaa5xKeraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-hoodie-culture-fighting-insecurities-and-vulnerabilities-one-hoodie-at-a-time.html><span>←</span><span>The Hoodie Culture: Fighting insecurities and vulnerabilities one hoodie at a time</span></a>
