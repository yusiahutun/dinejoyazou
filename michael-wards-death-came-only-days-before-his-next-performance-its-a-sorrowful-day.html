Michael’s role and talents will forever remain a crucial part of the band’s history.</p><p>“His contributions to music began before his time with the Wallflowers and continued long after his time with the band. Listening to Thin Lizzy on a sorrowful day. Rest now Mike. Much love to his family and his two children.”</p><p>Ward’s band Gogol Bordello also shared a tribute on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>They penned: “This is beyond sad and heavy for those of us who had a special bond with Mike.</p><p>“He came to share & champion our keen understanding of what’s it really all about: camaraderie n good laughter that we get to take with us at the end. He treasured the cellular memory of that cathartic camaraderie like we did and was boldly sentimental about it while being absolutely cold-blooded killer as a player: be it CRO-magnonian riffs, progy shredding or steady acoustic guitar finesse. Mike had it covered.”</p><p>In another post, they added: “So this is beyond sad and heavy for all of us who had a special bond with Mike.</p><p>“‘Cause he was exactly the kind of a guy who knew a thing or two about a special bond, like for years wearing on stage strictly a t-shirt of Norwegian metallists @Kvelertak which he and his son Tennessee agreed upon as their favorite band.”</p><p>The group finished: “Sail on sweet brother man, a true sailor philosopher and doer that left us with a lot of good laughs distilled out of a broken heart.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-talented-star>Talented star</h2><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> was nominated for five <a href=#>Grammy</a> Awards throughout his career, and with The Wallflowers, took home the statue for Best Rock Performance by a Duo/Group with Vocal in 1998 for their hit One Headlight.</p><p>He was a founding member of the alternative rock band School of Fish in the 1990s.</p><p>Recently, he still performed and taught guitar classes online.</p><p>Michael Ward was also set to perform in Las Vegas today, Friday, April 5, before his death.</p><p>The star is survived by his 24-year-old son, Tennessee, and 10-year-old son, Odin Von Ward.</p><p>Fans have been paying tribute to Michal Ward after hearing the news of his death.</p><p>One commended his talent: “RIP Michael Ward of Wallflowers renown. I guess I’m picky about guitarists, styles, tones etc and his were always interesting and great examples of serving the song.”</p><p>A second wrote on <a href=#>Twitter</a>: “Some sad news to share from The Wallflowers Facebook page: Guitarist Michael Ward has passed away. Sending my love to his friends and family during this difficult time.”</p><p>While a third added: “Really sad to hear guitarist Michael Ward passed yesterday. He played lead on The Wallflowers’ “Bringing Down the Horse,” a record that really shaped my musical tastes in high school.</p><p>“Ward also played with John Hiatt, Ben Harper and many more. RIP.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2WCcLnInJ%2BanZxixKK%2Bw6xknZ2RqbVur8CmnGannqHGbrDAsqpmmpWbvLOxjKGgrGWemsW1ec%2BeqZ%2BnoqKur6%2FEZqCtq12WerS70aumsJ6loXqlrdho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-wedding-details-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's royal wedding - 10 magical details and best photos</span></a>
