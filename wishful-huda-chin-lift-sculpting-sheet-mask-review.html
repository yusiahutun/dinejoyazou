The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Wishful Chin Lift Sculpting Sheet Mask</a> is one of two masks under this drop, and the one I had to try first. Like <a href=# id=auto-tag_wishful data-tag=wishful>Wishful</a>‘s first launch, Yo Glow Enzyme Scrub, these new masks are K-beauty inspired as Kattan discovered chin-lifting masks while visiting South Korea. She worked to create her own formula to tackle specific skin concerns, many of which I have as well.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p>As someone who only <a href=#>gets breakouts</a> on her chin and jaw, I’m the queen on multi-masking. I focus all my masks on the bottom half of my face to calm <a href=#>hormonal acne</a> and reduce redness. A mask focused just on my chin was basically created for me. I’ve used Korean chin-sculpting masks before and enjoyed the targeted treatment so I was excited to <a href=#>try Wishful’s</a>. The thick, hydrogel mask felt cool to the touch and fit over my chin and ears comfortably. I love that you can wear the mask and run around doing chores at home and it stays put.</p><p>The mask felt nice and luxe on my skin while powerful ingredients worked to do their job. Peppermint cools and calms redness, Orchid extract helps reduce the appearance of <a href=#>fine lines and wrinkles</a>, <a href=#>niacinamide</a> brightens, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 works as an anti-wrinkle peptide and Adenosine soothes skin’s texture. Note that there is fragrance so keep that in mind if you’re sensitive to them. I prefer skincare without fragrance but I didn’t get any irritation from this one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wishful-huda-2188.jpg><p>I left the mask on for 20-30 minutes per the directions. To be honest, I didn’t really want to take it off. It felt like a boost of self-care that I desperately need right now. Once I did finally remove it, my skin felt calmer and the texture felt smooth and soft. That’s all I hope for from a chin mask. As much as it would be magical if it gave me a true sculpted chin in 20 minutes, a mask really isn’t going to do that. You’ll need some medical intervention for that.</p><p>Still, it’s a fun and different way to try a <a href=#>sheet mask</a>. I just wish more than one came in a pack so I can repeat the treatment a few times a week to really see if it brightens and helps with fine lines. At less than $10 per mask, an affordable set would make sense for the future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wishful-chin-mask-packshot.jpg><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>Shop</a> both the Chin Lift mask as well as the new Wishful Thirst Trap Cocoon Mask ($9 at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sephora</a>) now.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
