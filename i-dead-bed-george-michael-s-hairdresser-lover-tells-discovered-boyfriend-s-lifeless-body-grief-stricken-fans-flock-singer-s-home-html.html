While living in a basement flat in Peckham, he and Ridgeley wrote Club Tropicana – a joyous anthem to the shallow pleasures of free cocktails on a sunshine holiday.</span></p><img id=i-278689bc355d089b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/12/26/11/3BA25A8500000578-4065534-A_musical_great_known_for_both_his_chart_topping_hits_and_his_tu-a-2_1482751915302.jpg height=654 width=470 alt="A musical great known for both his chart-topping hits and his turbulent personal life, George Michael was a giant of popular culture" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>A musical great known for both his chart-topping hits and his turbulent personal life, George Michael was a giant of popular culture</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He was only 18 when it was a hit – and he and Ridgeley found themselves instantly famous, and the objects of screaming desire for their many fans.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Wham! had a No 1 album, too, with Fantastic, followed by another No 1 album with Make It Big. In all, he achieved four UK No 1s with Wham! and five as a solo artist.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He sold more than 100million records worldwide and is one of the most successful UK chart artists of all time. He was, of course, the prettiest boy in Wham, with an absurdly bouffant do, deep tan, love of sportswear and golden highlights to match his gold hooped earring.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But there was unease behind the toothpaste smile. He told an interviewer: 'I realised early on that being on the road to pop stardom was not going to bring me happiness, but I couldn't get off.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He confessed to his best friend Ridgeley and backing singer Shirlie Kemp when he was only 19 that he believed he was gay, but they dismissed it.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Even after Wham! split in 1986 and the truth was pretty much an open secret in the media, he remained in the closet for another 12 years. 'I was spared all kinds of things by my own denial, not just the Press,' he said.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In his book Bare, published in 1990, he painted an image of himself as a red-blooded womaniser, citing affairs with Brooke Shields and model Kathy Yeung. There was even an extraordinary flirtation with Princess Diana, whom he met at the Live Aid concert in 1985. They became close friends, but not before Michael had fended off an apparent invitation to an affair from the unhappily married princess. 'There was no question she was very attracted to me,' he said in a TV interview, but noted: 'It would have been disastrous to do anything.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In 1989 he met the fashion designer Anselmo Feleppa, a handsome Brazilian face in the crowd at the Rock in Rio concert. Feleppa idolised Michael and had secured a ticket near the front; he even took to hanging out at the singer's hotel in the hopes of meeting him.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Within a few weeks of their meeting they were living together, quietly away from public gaze, in Los Angeles. But only six months later Feleppa announced he was HIV positive. Michael nursed Feleppa for the next three-and-a-half years until his death from a brain haemorrhage. Afterwards, the singer couldn't write for a long time. When he did, he returned with Older, and the moving song Jesus To A Child.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><img id=i-94ad8e4af98c751f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/12/26/11/05F27C53000005DC-4065534-Michael_pictured_in_1983_with_Andrew_Ridgeley_said_himself_that_-a-4_1482751915306.jpg height=876 width=962 alt="Michael (pictured in 1983 with Andrew Ridgeley) said himself that he suffered from two afflictions ¿'grief and self-abuse'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Michael (pictured in 1983 with Andrew Ridgeley) said himself that he suffered from two afflictions –'grief and self-abuse'</p><img id=i-199384c97aa703d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/12/26/11/3BA261A000000578-4065534-Despite_a_glittering_life_onstage_Michael_had_endured_a_turbulen-a-1_1482751915244.jpg height=656 width=962 alt="Despite a glittering life onstage Michael had endured a turbulent personal life which saw him battle substance abuse and fall seriously ill with pneumonia in 2011 (pictured, on his 'Symphonica' tour in Vienna, 2012)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Despite a glittering life onstage Michael had endured a turbulent personal life which saw him battle substance abuse and fall seriously ill with pneumonia in 2011 (pictured, on his 'Symphonica' tour in Vienna, 2012)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'That was the most inspired album of my career because of the feelings around bereavement,' he said.

That's the way we choose to live.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He wrote the song Outside following the arrest and the video featured kissing policemen. It all seemed joyfully mischievous, if a little puerile – but in fact he had all but stopped in his tracks creatively. 'I was probably more stoned in those days – I was existing on a balance of Starbucks and weed,' he told an interviewer, admitting to a 25 joints a day dope habit.</span></p><img id=i-e403cdf641cb6df3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/12/26/11/3BA25A8D00000578-4065534-Michael_enjoyed_a_successful_career_that_spanned_four_decades_ea-a-3_1482751915303.jpg height=641 width=470 alt="Michael enjoyed a successful career that spanned four decades, earning numerous number one hits, which included his 1996 single 'FastLove'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Michael enjoyed a successful career that spanned four decades, earning numerous number one hits, which included his 1996 single 'FastLove'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He promised he was happy, but there was very little work released other than compilations and greatest hits.

He lost his licence and carried out community service. He passed a roadside sobriety test, but said in an interview he had 'a problem with sleeping pills' at that time. In July 2010 he drove his Range Rover into Snappy Snaps in Hampstead – for which he was jailed at Pentonville and then Highpoint open prison in Suffolk.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In an interview after coming out of prison he said: 'This was a hugely shameful thing to have done repeatedly, so karmically I felt like I had a bill to pay … It's so much easier to take any form of punishment if you believe you actually deserve it, and I did.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In March 2011 he released a cover version, True Faith, for charity and later that year he released another cover version to mark the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton – You and I.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>His last self-penned single release was White Light in 2012, to mark the 30 years since his first single, co-written with Ridgeley entered the charts.
