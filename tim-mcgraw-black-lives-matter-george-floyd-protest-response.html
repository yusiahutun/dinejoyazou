He begins by admitting he does not know how it feels to be black in America, but he believes all people have the same inherent human rights.</p><p>"I believe that love, respect and understanding of each other is a light to guide our way," McGraw says.</p><p>"We must find a way to shine light on what is happening. Find a way to talk, find a way to understand, find a way to hold accountable those who won't see, won't understand and won't love," he adds. "I wish I knew the answers."</p><p>McGraw's statement (as seen in full below) is not a definitive statement or the answer to what's been happening in American cities since last week, when George Floyd (a 46-year-old black man) was handcuffed and pinned to the ground by&nbsp;Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, killing him. Floyd&nbsp;had been&nbsp;detained on suspicion of using a&nbsp;counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Protests over his death began last Tuesday and spread nationwide late last week and over the weekend. Many became violent and destructive.</p><p>Several country artists have taken to social media to express similar sentiments. <a href=#>Dan + Shay</a> urged fans to use their voices to make chance. <a href=#>Jimmie Allen</a> says&nbsp;it's our responsibility as humans to shine a light on the mistreatment of other human beings. <a href=#>Thomas Rhett</a> spoke of his anger and heartbreak, adding that he's witnessed it firsthand with band members of color while touring.</p><p>"I stand with George and his family and all those who have faced racism," <a href=#>he writes.</a> "I stand with my wife and my daughters. We will be fighting this fight for the rest of our lives. Rest&nbsp;in Peace, George. We are not letting this go."</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Visit the Show Must Be Paused to Learn How to Give Financially</a><p><strong>These Country Songs Were Inspired&nbsp;by Real Life Events:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmraGdYrqks9GarmaanJawrHnLoq2eq12irrXAxKtkoJ2fp7SmecWlprKcXaW%2FsMDErKtmqpWovbC60p5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-cool-cat-by-queen.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of Cool Cat by Queen</span></a>
