However, prior to being known as a Hollywood conservative, he was a beloved game show host with experience of working in shows such as "Wheel of Fortune", "Love Connection" and "Dating Game."</h3><h2>Three Marriages Ended in Divorce</h2><p>Not every marriage ends in happily ever after. But when three of your consecutive weddings end in divorce, there is no doubt it can be painful. No one understands this pain better than American TV host Chuck Woolery who has faced three divorces in his life.</p><p>Woolery first tied the knot with <strong>Margaret Hayes</strong>, in 1961 when he was just twenty years old. The pair remained together for ten years and gave birth to two children, a daughter <strong>Katherine Woolery</strong> and son <strong>Chad Woolery.</strong> Sadly, their son died in a motorcycle accident in 1986 at age 19.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/01/20/chuck-woolery-second-wife-is-actress-jo-ann-pflug--1579518028.jpg width=450 height=350 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Chuck Woolery's second wife is actress Jo Ann Pflug. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Getty Images</span></strong><p>One year after divorce from his first wife, "Love Connection" host exchanged vows with actress <strong>Jo Ann Pflug</strong>. Sadly, this time also, the marriage lasted for only a few years. The couple divorced in 1980 after eight years of marriage. From the marriage, Chuck has a daughter <strong>Melissa Woolery</strong>.</p><p>After two failed divorce, Chuck took his time before going into a lifelong commitment this time. His third wedding with <strong>Teri Nelson</strong> happened in 1985, after five years from his second divorce. As the couple celebrated their tenth anniversary, many thought this pair is going to last a lifetime; sadly, however, that was not the case.</p><p>The couple separated in 2003 and eventually divorced in 2005 after nineteen years of relationship. From this nuptial, he has two sons, <strong>Michael Woolery</strong> and<strong> Sean Woolery</strong>.</p><h2>Enjoying Marital Bliss With Fourth Wife Kim Woolery</h2><p>Woolery was confident that someday he would find his soulmate, so despite three failed marriages, he never gave hope on the wedding. So, in 2006, a year after his third divorce, he again tied the knot. This time with hairstylist Kim Barnes who, after marriage, adopted her husband's last name and became <a href=# rel=noopener>Kim Woolery</a>.</p><p>"The Dating Game" host met his future fourth wife Kim on a blind date in 2003, after separation from his third wife. Since Kim was twenty-five younger than Woolery, many thought the relationships would not last long; however, the couple remained steady for three years of courtship and eventually decided to make a lifelong commitment.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/01/20/chuck-woolery-and-his-wife-kim-woolery-on-their-wedding-day--1579517581.jpg width=450 height=337 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Chuck Woolery and his wife Kim Woolery on their wedding day. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: The Cave of Pythia</span></strong><p>The festivities took place at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.

Meanwhile, the groom looked dashing in a traditional black tuxedo with matching black bow-tie.</p><p>Thirteen years have passed since Woolery's fourth marriage, and thankfully it is still intact with no rumors of separation or divorce. Hoping that it remains so in the coming future as well.</p><h2>The Original Host of "Wheel of Fortune," Chuck Woolery Boats Net-Worth In Millions</h2><p>The 78-year-old Chuck Woolery holds an overall net-worth of <strong>$15 millions</strong>. He earned this fortune from various professions over the years.</p><h3>Composer of 'Naturally Stoned'</h3><p>After his first marriage failed, Woolery moved to Nashville from his hometown of Kentucky to start a career in music. While there, he formed a duo called The Avant-Garde alongside <strong>Elkin Bubba Fowler</strong>. The group composed a song Naturally Stoned, which became super popular.&nbsp;</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/01/20/chuck-woolery-was-a-member-of-avant-garde-and-composed-naturally-stoned--1579517661.jpg width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Chuck Woolery was a member of Avant-Garde and composed 'Naturally Stoned.' </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Pinterest</span></strong><p>Sadly, the duo did not last long, and they broke up after just three singles.
