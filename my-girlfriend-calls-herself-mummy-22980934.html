He decided to take to Reddit to ask for advice – admitting he was reluctant to break up with his other half."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

She knitted me a bib and oversized booties. She bought me a pacifier with adult-sized onesies.</p><p>“Her favourite activity is her cuddling me while she rocks back and forth gently while she rubs my hair. She’ll look lovingly into my eyes while saying stuff like ‘mummy loves you’.</p><p>“The most recent thing she bought, which is what brought me here, are adult-sized diapers. I asked if she was serious when she pulled them out of the bag.”</p><p>Freaked out that his girlfriend had bought him adult nappies, the lad asked Redditors for their advice.</p><p>He questioned: “Is this normal? Has anyone even been in a situation like this? Am I kidding myself?”</p><p>The post has since gone viral on the Redditships Twitter page, where it garnered 2,400 likes.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, many were baffled by the dilemma.</p><p>They said it was wrong for the girlfriend to explore her unusual interest without asking for consent first.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=22605657><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Adult baby sacked for 'being childish' can't find new job as bosses hate nappies" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=22605657><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article22605675.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_JS217870227_Main.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=22605657>Adult baby sacked for 'being childish' can't find new job as bosses hate nappies</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=21441302><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="Mum accused of 'living in the 50s' after waking up at 4.30am to cook for her husband" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=21441302><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article22980994.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Man-as-baby-Child-in-diaper-with-pink-teddy-bear.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article21441309.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/81227200_1453982081444298_6164813258575314944_Main.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=21441302>Mum accused of 'living in the 50s' after waking up at 4.30am to cook for her husband</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p>A commenter said: “The fetish itself isn’t the problem – but taking it this far without actually discussing it with him and ignoring his concerns about the diaper isn’t OK.</p><p>“Limits need to be set in a situation like this and it has to be talked about.”</p><p>Another wrote: “There is no problem with this kink.
