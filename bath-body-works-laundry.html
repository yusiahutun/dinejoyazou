Now, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1143506>Bath & Body Works is coming for your laundry</a>. After selling out on the app-exclusive pre-launch, White Barn Fabric Care is back in stock online only. But we have a feeling, not for long.</p><p>The retailer rolled out two major products: Fabric Care Detergent and Fabric Care Fragrance Booster. The former “combines the science of stain fighting with perfumer-created fine fragrance,” per the brand, available in 14 scents you already know and love. There are also four totally new ones to make the chore of doing laundry a bit more enjoyable.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bath-body-works-black-history.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/power-sheets-fi.jpg><p>The concentrated formula washes up to 64 large loads and cleans well in cold water. The chic little bottles are made of 85 percent recycled plastic, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bath-Body-Works-Lavender-Vanilla-Fabric-Care-Detergent.jpeg><p>And if the <a href=# id=auto-tag_laundry-detergent data-tag=laundry-detergent>laundry detergent</a> scent isn’t enough for you, or if you’d rather use your own detergent and add a little boost, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1186976>Bath & Body Works</a> also launched Fabric Care Fragrance Boosters. They’re available in eight popular fragrances and four brand-new scents created just for this collection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bath-Body-Works-Mahogany-Teakwood-Fabric-Care-Fragrance-Booster.jpeg><p>Reviews of the new products are very good, to say the least. One reviewer is such a fan of the Fabric Care Fragrance Boosters, that she wrote a whole paragraph: “Absolutely in love with this! I use with the detergent. I do have to add water to the detergent dispenser bc it’s so thick. I had tried everything to kill the musky smell of my husbands clothes & this is literally the only brand detergent that works! Plus, my house, closets, beds, & attire all smell amazing now!!!”</p><p>Another is a big fan of the Fabric Care Detergent in the popular candle scent, Champagne Toast. She wrote: “I bought this as launch for members and don’t regret it. I can’t wait until they release the full line because this sold out quick. I thought this fragrance was going to be strong because it is concentrated, but it wasn’t. Soft and subtle. Kept my clothes fresh for at least 14 days. I really use it on the towels.”</p><p>Hurry and grab your <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.bathandbodyworks.com/g/laundry-care rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">faves</a> while you can.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8eopJ5nYWuBc4WPb2abmaSdeqO7w7JksKeioMBuuMCupZ2qqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./design-challenges-to-boost-creativity.html><span>←</span><span>5 Design Challenges That Will Boost Your Creativity</span></a>
