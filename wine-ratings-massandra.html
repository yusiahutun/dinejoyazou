But he was not the first to identify the quality potential of these vineyards. The famed Massandra winery with a 100-year-plus history is located in the resort city of Yalta, on the Black Sea coast in the southern Ukraine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the early 1890s, Tsar Nicholas II established the Massandra winery near his summer residence in Livadia to supply wines for his personal use, and for the imperial court. His chief wine maker was Prince Lev Golitsyn who had a reputation for producing award-winning wines and went on to win the Grand Prix in Paris in 1900 for his sparkling wine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Massandra cellars are contained in seven 150-metre long tunnels that house a million bottles of wine. The wines have survived Russia and Ukraine's turbulent history. In the 1920s, Stalin was impressed by the wines, and saved the winery from destruction. Entranced by the winery, Stalin made Massandra Palace his summer residence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the second world war, the threat of a German invasion saw the Massandra collection evacuated to three secret locations. The only casualty was the unbottled 1941 vintage, which was disposed of into the sea. It was said that it was the first time the Black Sea had ever turned red. The Massandra collection made further headlines when Sotheby's auctioned a bottle of the 1775 Sherry for US$43,500 in 2001. Today the winery has over 20 wines in its portfolio. These include dry whites, red, sweet and fortified wines. The dry wines are rustic, with oxidative (walnut-like) notes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The sweet and fortified wines really stand out. This is a fantastic opportunity to sample a taste of history.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The traditional variety for sherry is the palomino but the Massandra version is made from sercial and verdelho which are traditionally used to make Madeira. Abillo - a Spanish variety known for its high glycerol content - is added to increase body.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aged for four years. Notes of salted almonds. Medium-bodied with salty notes, crisp acidity with long finish. HK$330</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Grapes are sourced from Livadia. The first port was made in 1891, and is one of the first wines produced for him. Nicholas purportedly carried his favourite wine in a hip flask. The blend differs from traditional varieties - this port is made from 100 per cent cabernet sauvignon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dark blackcurrant, grapey notes. On the palate, the wine is concentrated, high in alcohol with a high level of residual sugar, firm tannins and long finish. Still youthful with long term ageing potential. HK$330</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the best expressions of muscat, showing the region's potential. Intense perfume, floral aromatics. Full bodied, very sweet. Rich, concentrated, long finish. Can age for decades. HK$390</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wines are available from elcup.asia</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Black Sea winery invested with Tsar quality</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9mfnaAlXBsaK%2BZo7JuvsCtoKefo2K6or%2FSmqWdqpE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mtv-vmas-justin-timberlake-and-megan-thee-stallions-backstage-fight-was-something-else.html><span>←</span><span>MTV VMAs: Justin Timberlake and Megan Thee Stallion's backstage 'fight' was something else</span></a>
