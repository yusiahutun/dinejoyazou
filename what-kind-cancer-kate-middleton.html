Cancer in the abdominal region could mean many different kinds affecting digestive system organs, including the stomach, liver, large intestine, small intestine, pancreas, gallbladder, esophagus, and rectum.</p><p>“The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.”</p><p>She also talked about the impact it had on her family. “As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be OK.”</p><p>She praised her husband William as “a great source of <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1742011/prince-william-kate-middleton-conspiracy-theories/>comfort and reassurance</a>”, Kate added: “This of course came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family.”</p><p>Honoring those who have been diagnosed with cancer, Kate ends the video with a hopeful tone. “While I complete my treatments. My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I’m able. But for now, I must focus on making a full recovery. At this time, I’m also thinking of all those whose lives have been affected by cancer, For everyone facing this disease in whatever form.”</p><p>Kensington Palace&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>announced&nbsp;</a>that Kate Middleton had a “planned abdominal surgery” at The London Clinic on January 16, 2024. “The surgery was successful, and it is expected that she will remain in hospital for ten to fourteen days, before returning home to continue her recovery,” the statement said. “Based on the current medical advice, she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-happened-to-kate-middleton-s-medical-files>What happened to Kate Middleton’s medical files?</h2><p>The private clinic where the Princess of Wales was being treated amid her undisclosed abdominal procedure is being investigated over a possible delay in reporting an alleged security breach.</p><p>According to&nbsp;The&nbsp;Telegraph, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) requires organizations to alert them of data security breaches within 72 hours of discovery, but the London Clinic&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>reportedly did not contact the privacy and data watchdog</a>&nbsp;until more than a week after Middleton was discharged. That was on January 29, following her 13-day stay. An ICO source confirmed to&nbsp;The Guardian&nbsp;that the “timeliness of reporting” was included in the investigation.</p><p>A source previously told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Mirror</a>&nbsp;that the hospital was taking the incident very seriously. “This is a major security breach and incredibly damaging for the hospital, given its unblemished reputation for treating members of the&nbsp;Royal Family,” the source said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Senior hospital bosses contacted&nbsp;Kensington Palace&nbsp;immediately after the incident was brought to their attention and assured the palace there&nbsp;<a href=#>would be a full investigation</a>. The whole medical staff have been left utterly shocked and distraught over the allegations and were very hurt that a trusted colleague could have possibly been responsible for such a breach of trust and ethics.”</p><p>An expert told Newsweek that the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Princess of Wales could sue the hospital</a>&nbsp;because a crime may have been committed under Section 170 of Britain’s Data Protection Act. “Individuals, such as—in this case—The Princess of Wales, can also bring claims for compensation under the U.K. GDPR, and for ‘misuse of private information,’ where their data protection and privacy rights have been infringed,” Jon Baines, a senior data protection specialist at Mishcon de Reya, said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm1pcWhoZMSprdNmoqKmlGKworrCnqlmo5Gpsm65yJ2bpZ2kpLtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scarlett-johansson-colin-jost-armani-white-house-correspondents-dinner-8640125.html><span>←</span><span>Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost in Armani at White House</span></a>
