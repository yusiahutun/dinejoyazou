Netz doesn’t post much content but still has a growing fanbase.</p><p>His videos are mainly posts of himself dancing, lip-syncing, and funny clips. He doesn’t use the platform to showcase his gaming talent.</p><p>And like all other online celebrities, Rani has a substantial following on Instagram. Netz has over 621K followers, and most of his content is centered around his personal life.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Talks About His Depression</strong></h2><p><br>While Ronaldo appears to have it all; a rising gaming career, a significant net worth, and a circle of equally successful friends, it’s not all that great.</p><p>Netz battles mental health issues, particularly anxiety and depression.</p><p>During interviews, Rami has gone on the record talking about his struggles and how severe they are.</p><p>Rami <a href=# rel=noopener>talked</a> with his fans about what he was going through. He said:</p><p>“Listen, I’m just gonna be straight honest, I’m just gonna get straight to the point. Like earlier today, bro, like I was really frustrated. And I’ve been just thinking, bro, like streaming, is a way for me to talk to people. It’s a way for me to explain myself. But I’ve been like so depressed I can’t even lie. And I’ve been faking being happy on streaming.”</p><p>Netz went on to explain how he struggles with everyone in his personal life struggling to understand him, including his mom and girlfriend.</p><p>Since he uses humor to express himself, Rami inadvertently paints a poker face that no one can see through, so he struggles alone.</p><p>His depression stems from overthinking his future and everything else in his current life, which he struggles to ignore. But despite his struggles, Netz finds solace in his online community because people offer him support and just simple online companionship.</p><p>He has a worried fanbase who wishes the best for him in his mental health journey.</p><h2><strong>Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>Stable Ronaldo is in a relationship with <a href=# rel=noopener>Angie</a>, who also streams on Twitch.&nbsp;They started dating in 2020.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Douglas Nunes Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Stable Ronaldo – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Stable Ronaldo worth?
