"And there was a lot of -- during the service -- these wonderful older Italian women just whispering to me about food."</p><p>"In what way?" Kimmel asked before Gosling went into character.</p><p>"So at one point, this one woman said, 'There's a tortellini in the freezer,'" Gosling said in his best Italian accent. "And later on, almost towards the vows, another woman said, 'There's a smoked mozzarella in the fridge.' And then another woman went, 'It's from Naples.'"</p><p>"Did you ever get any of that smoked mozzarella?" Kimmel asked.</p><p>"Yeah, it was like an angel crying on your tongue," Gosling quipped.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ecb5c2b8-be78-5b19-8a43-64915695bad6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:823c0b84-fc1f-51c3-9af7-229482c159d5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3a/5by4/2018/09/05/3a813da64deb5dc9958e0081d986b0a0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Trump Doesn't Want to Watch Ryan Gosling Movie 'First Man' Because There's Not Enough American Flag</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Kimmel then asked the actor if had been "swarmed" by paparazzi or fans while he was abroad. Gosling said he hadn't.</p><p>"One lady said she'd seen me in a film, and then she said, 'Why you no say nothing?'" he joked, again in his best Italian accent.</p><p>The actor also gushed about his two baby girls -- Esmeralda, 4, and Amada, 2 -- who he shares with partner <strong><a href=#>Eva Mendes</a></strong>. He told Kimmel that, because of his very convincing role playing astronaut Neil Armstrong in "First Man," his daughters think he's a real-life astronaut.</p><p>It all started when the girls stopped by the set to watch their dad shoot a scene.</p><p>"They came on this day where I was shooting a launch scene, so I was in a space suit and pretending to launch," Gosling explained. "I think they think I'm an astronaut now. My oldest said the other day, she pointed to the moon and she was like, 'That's where you work, right?'"</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
