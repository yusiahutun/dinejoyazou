Louie Higaki, GMM, AnthroLiving, described the artistry behind its appearance,</span><span> and we’d say it’s pretty unique. “</span><span>The Gleaming Primrose Mirror was inspired by French Antique Gilt Mirrors seen throughout Paris. As the years have evolved, so has the mirror with new shapes and finishes,” they said. “The mirror is a style chameleon adding drama to any architectural aesthetic retaining her star of the show status within AnthroLiving.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We love the </span><i><span>drama</span></i><span> it’s guaranteed to bring any room, especially considering the brand also says the piece is meant to “evoke the spirit of what could have been found in a Parisian Maison,” with the idea that it would have lived in a grand foyer or entryway during its “original heyday.” With that said, if you’re dealing with a much smaller space (raises hand), the 3-foot option is perfect for hanging on the wall in your living area, or propping up on your desk or vanity table. </span><i><span>But, </span></i><span>if you are able to go all-out, the 7-foot option is Anthropologie’s most popular seller and is discounted by a whopping $480.</span></p><p><span>Additional sizing options are a 5-foot option, and a 6-foot floor option, both of which are also available in the four beautiful shades—black, gold, silver and </span><span>Verdegris.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This </span><a href=# rel=nofollow><span>feature sale</span></a><span> only runs through the weekend, so let’s just say there’s no better time to treat yourself than literally right now.</span></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8eopJ5nYWeAeoCQaWaapqSdv7C8zqWmoKGVYr2ztcyrpqydXaK2s77Oq2SsmZyafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tess-sanchez-wiki-bio-religion-net-worth-sister-family-age.html><span>←</span><span>Tess Sanchez Wiki Bio, Religion, Net Worth, Sister, Family, Age</span></a>
