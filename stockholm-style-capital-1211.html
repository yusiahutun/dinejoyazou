Walking out into the crisp Nordic air, you are greeted by a wall celebrating Sweden's finest: important-looking pictures of Stellan Skarsgård, Greta Garbo, Björn Borg—and Acne cofounders Jonny Johannson and Mikael Schiller.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Johannson and Schiller are Sweden's favorite fashion sons. After they started as part of a creative collective (Ambition to Create Novel Expressions) in 1996, their buzz really began when the company designed 100 pairs of raw-denim jeans that they gave to friends and family. Today, Acne's not-so-basics occupy a sweet spot between art and street, high concept and commercial.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I am always very excited about something raw and simple," Johannson, the label's creative director, says. "I like emotional crashes between things; you might not like the elements by themselves, but together they work."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Acne enjoys a cultlike, growing loyalty—a kind of insider nod of recognition. The groovy girls love it. French actresses Léa Seydoux and Clémence Poésy are regularly spotted in Acne pieces, and British It girl Alexa Chung could double as its mascot. "Everything Acne does is effortlessly cool," Chung says. "I love the way they integrate masculinity and femininity, and the clothes are functional without being bland."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I love Acne too. The "Acne boys," who I met through an Australian friend, their head of public relations, Anthony Kendal, are also, in their very essence, cool. They love art, they love fashion, but they also love life. Johannson and his partner, Teresa, live in Stockholm with their three young children, while Schiller divides his time between the city (where he owns a minimalist home on a small island, accessed by a dinky motorboat or Jet Ski) and New York.</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Clémence and Johannson Poésy</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I love taking my boat home to my house in Stockholm," he says. "I just walk around barefoot." And what an island it is. While watching the sunset, you are likely to see a lone Swede rowing by or, more ingeniously, a family in a sauna. On a boat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A compact city inhabiting 14 islands in an expansive archipelago, Stockholm is the embodiment of beautiful form (and that's not just the famously attractive locals). The city center lies on the waterfront, where boats take off for Finland, Norway, or just Gröna Lund, an amusement park across the bay. The year is divided into two seasons, summer light and winter dark—one celebrated, the other often inebriated. In summer, Stockholm averages more than 17 hours a day of daylight, but the opposite applies in winter, so one could hardly blame the locals for drinking their feelings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"During the winter, I love doing typical Nordic things like going long-distance tour skating on the Baltic Sea or taking walks in the snow around the Kungliga Djurgården park," says Schiller. "But the darkness gets to you, so I also try to travel south."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But the north in the winter has its charms—one of them being Stockholm's fantastic food. "Suck it!" a table of Acne people is encouraging me at Teatergrillen, the sceniest restaurant in Stockholm, where you may meet real live Swedish princesses over champagne. My tablemates' instruction refers to a pile of crayfish that is most enjoyed, apparently, by sucking the juice out of it before shelling. (Swedes are known to have epic crayfish parties—<i>kräftskivas</i>—in the summer.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Apart from the traditional meatballs, food here is prepared with a light hand. To leave the city without dinner at Matbaren, one of Mathias Dahlgren's Michelin-starred restaurants at the Grand Hôtel, would be a fatal error. I had never before had something as simple as "pumpkin and broccoli" that I could describe as transcendent, and yet I had it here. Also, do not miss the tuna tartare at the Lydmar Hotel, which is a testament to airy chic. Schiller adds, "I also like Sturehof [superfresh seafood] and La Vecchia Signora [an Italian restaurant in hipster hood Södermalm] for dinner and Saturnus [baguettes and legendary cinnamon rolls] for breakfast."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The biggest scene in Stockholm, though, is Riche, a bar and restaurant where time ceases to matter and the stylish locals drink and flirt until the wee hours. Because you need to eat meatballs somewhere, here is the place. It also serves reindeer, if one isn't a Christmas sentimentalist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In all seasons, Stockholm is a walking town. Stroll to the Moderna Museet on the island of Skeppsholmen, which has a beautifully curated collection of modern art, much of it by Sweden's own. Fotografiska, Stockholm's photography museum, has recently housed large exhibits of Robert Mapplethorpe and Chinese artist Liu Bolin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The city's best stores are centered in the exclusive neighborhood of Östermalm. Swedish design institution Svenskt Tenn is famed for its signature botanical prints, while Malmstenbutiken specializes in blond-wood furniture in typical Swedish style. Fancy antique dealers can be found on Kommendörsgatan, and Bukowskis auction house is worth a look, even if it's through the window, Little Match Girl—style. On the south side of town, Södermalm is the place for vintage and young-designer wares.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Acne's main store is located underneath the Nobis Hotel in the former Kreditbanken, famed for the 1973 hostage drama that inspired the term "Stockholm syndrome." The vault where prisoners were kept is now a fitting room. (However, the staff will gladly let you out.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But the best way to see Stockholm is with friends who know this glorious city inside out. So I suggest bonding with a nearby Swede immediately. After all, everyone needs Stockhomies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGisopbDpriMnaCnoZ6cfKKw1aKanmeRbYBze9KtppyjmKS5rnnSrbClnV2YrrG105qjZmliZn5w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-jersey-police-mohamed-bounaouar-shot-dead-knife-naked-html.html><span>←</span><span>New Jersey cops shoot knife-wielding naked man after he destroyed relative's home and trapped family</span></a>
