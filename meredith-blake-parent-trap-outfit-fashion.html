Even today, I'm inspired by outfits worn by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sleeping Beauty's Maleficent</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jennifer from Jennifer's Body</a>, and as a kid watching The Parent Trap, I definitely didn't realize how well-dressed Meredith Blake was — especially during that infamous camping trip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, Meredith was technically a 26-year-old gold digger who was mean to her boyfriend's kids, Hallie Parker and Annie James (aka Lindsay Lohan). But, at the same time, her old school and glamorous aesthetic is similar to mine. She loved tailored pieces, accessorized with floppy hats, and while camping wasn't her forte (remember the lizard incident?), she still chose something appropriate yet cute after receiving a *last-minute* invite: a matching black and white set, consisting of a zip-up sports bra, cropped leggings, and a jacket.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Disney</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm admittedly slacking on any sort of workout routine at the moment, but I would definitely wear this entire look while running errands or going for a leisurely walk. Thankfully, it doesn't seem like fitness was at the top of Meredith's mind in this case, either — she's still wearing multiple rings and put effort into her hairstyle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Either way, I did find similar bras from Outdoor Voices ($49, Originally $78; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>outdoorvoices.com</a>) and All Access ($78; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>net-a-porter.com</a>), and ASOS sells a tracksuit that gives me the same sort of vibe ($51; asos.com). With the perfect pair of leggings (Shop similar: $30, Originally $55; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>nordstrom.com</a>), channeling Meredith — without being obvious about it — is easy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To be honest, I'm not sure which part of me copying Meredith's camping outfit would be more surprising to younger me: the fact that I want to dress like 'Cruella' or that her 1998 style is still relevant today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yusdGem6KsmGKvra3KnmSpmaKau7V506uYqWWfqsGntdNmnZqrmJ68rw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-gloria-gaynor-finds-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel.html><span>←</span><span>How Gloria Gaynor Finds Light at the End of the Tunnel</span></a>
