Kate Middleton left hospital on Wednesday after staying for two weeks following a “planned” and “successful” surgery. During her stay, she was visited by her husband Prince William, and was receiving care at the same time as her father-in-law. While Kate was in for what was only described as an “abdominal” surgery, King Charles underwent the knife for his “enlarged prostate."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

During her stay, she was visited by her husband <a href=#>Prince William</a>, and was receiving care at the same time as her father-in-law. While Kate was in for what was only described as an “abdominal” surgery, <a href=#>King Charles</a> underwent the knife for his “enlarged prostate.” The monarch was treated at the same hospital as the future queen and was supported by his wife, <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a>. He and Kate left the clinic on the same day.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-middleton-was-not-photographed-leaving-hospital>Kate Middleton was not photographed leaving hospital</h2><p>Kate Middleton was being treated at The London Clinic and was there for 14 days. However, she left without being photographed. This was in contrast to Charles, 75, who was captured on camera by more than 20 photographers. There are two very plausible ways the 42-year-old could have gone unseen when she left.</p><p>Speaking on HELLO!’s podcast A Right Royal podcast, royal photographer James Whatling spoke about the theories on how Kate got away unnoticed. James was one of the photographers who managed to capture the king but didn’t see Kate.</p><p>He said there was a possibility she was helped by her personal assistant. The assistant, who has worked with her for more than a decade, Natasha Archer, could have gotten Kate into the back of her vehicle without anyone seeing.</p><p>Natasha was seen leaving the clinic with a handful of bags, which she could’ve been taking back to Adelaide Cottage.</p><p>Another speculation involves <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and his wife, who frequently use unmarked cars to get from place to place when they didn’t want to be seen.</p><p>He said: “Some people are saying that the Princess of Wales was in the back of the car, but I’ve studied the picture and I can’t see it.”</p><p>On the Harry and Meghan Markle’s theory, he continued: “All they really had to do was put the Princess of Wales in a car that was not really recognizable as a royal car. Harry and Meghan used to use unmarked people carriers – something like that would have been comfortable.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-won-t-resume-royal-duties-for-2-months>Kate won’t resume royal duties for 2 months</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1933627371-1024x683.jpg><p>Following Kate Middleton leaving the hospital on Wednesday, Kensington Palace <a href=#>provided an update</a> on the Princess of Wales’ condition.</p><p>They said on X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>): “The Prince and Princess wish to say a huge thank you to the entire team at The London Clinic, especially the dedicated nursing staff, for the care they have provided. The Wales family continues to be grateful for the well-wishes they have received from around the world.”</p><p>When they announced the <a href=#>royal’s</a> surgery, Kensington Palace expressed Kate’s wish for privacy and said that was why they wouldn’t reveal the specifics of her operation. They added she wouldn’t return to public duties for a while.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2V%2FcLfArZxmpZmZsa2x06ilZqSVm8FutM6sp6KskaF6trrNqKuim5WZerWtyqKloGWRYrmmrcVmpq6sXaSzbrnEoJ%2BapqNir7C7ymanoaekpLSzrc%2BhnKtlo5bGtHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fact-check-is-conor-mcgregor-going-to-host-wwe-wrestlemania-40-1283690.html><span>←</span><span>Fact Check: Is Conor McGregor Going to Host WWE WrestleMania 40?</span></a>
