In the U.S., December 26 is not recognized as a day off from work or school, and it is not marked by the same traditions that characterize Boxing Day celebrations in other parts of the world.</p><p>In countries where Boxing Day is observed, it is a public holiday, affording most people a day off from work and school. Families typically gather for meals, relax at home, attend sporting events, and engage in shopping.</p><p>Traditional Boxing Day foods include baked ham, pease pudding, and mince pies. The celebration extends to activities like horse racing, foxhunting, and rugby, aligning with the feast day of St. Stephen, who is also the patron saint of horses.</p><p>Boxing Day is celebrated on December 26 each year. However, if December 26 falls on a Saturday, the holiday is moved to the following Monday, ensuring that people can fully enjoy the festivities associated with this significant day.</p><p>Countries where Boxing Day is celebrated include, England, Wales, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and South Africa.
