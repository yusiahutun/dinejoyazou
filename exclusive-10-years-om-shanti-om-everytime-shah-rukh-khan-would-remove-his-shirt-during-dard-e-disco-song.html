I used to be lying on that and shouting on the mike," she said.&nbsp;</span></span></span> <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><span><span><span>She then went on to narrate a funny incident when she couldn't stop puking while Shah Rukh Khan showed off his body in Dard-e-Disco.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>"During Dard-e-Disco I had morning sickness so it was very funny because every time Shah Rukh would remove his shirt, I would throw up and he was like 'what is this' and I was like 'No No your body looks fab but it is just that I have three bodies inside me so I was just non-stop puking'."&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p><img alt title width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/om-shanti-om-3.jpg></p><p><span><span><span>When asked on how was it directing the duo especially Deepika Padukone since it was her first movie, Farah said, "Deepika was </span></span></span><span><span><span>absolutely</span></span></span><span><span><span> raw and you don't really have to do much when Shah Rukh is the hero. He just took her, I mean I would, of course, sit with her and tell her what to do but he would sit in the lunch break and motivate her. I would say Shah Rukh, I just have to say look down, look up, look left or right. He [Shah Rukh] was lovely actually and very patient and a very generous actor. I mean even if his take was good, he would do it hundred more times till her take is fine."</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Was there any particular scene where Deepika took a lot of takes to get it right? To this, Farah said, "There is one scene after Main Agar Kahoon song where they are walking on the empty set. I got a very special scene between the two, probably the only romantic scene between them. In that scene, he really helped Deepika out a lot. He was telling her that how you should pretend you are in love and all and she just broke down and told him that I was just 12 years old when Dilwale [DDLJ} released and I was like, 'did you have to tell him that right now when you were doing a romantic scene?'."</span></span></span></p><p><img alt title width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/Mainagar.jpg></p><p><span><span><span>Om Shanti Om is one of the movies where we find more stars making an appearance than an award show. When asked Farah how difficult was it to </span></span></span><span><span><span>co-ordinate</span></span></span><span><span><span> and get all of them together, she said, "We had too many cameos in the movie. You know actually, half the film industry is in this, not only half I think 3/4th is in the movie. Either, they are in the song or doing a cameo like Akshay Kumar, Abhishek Bachchan. It was lovely to make a movie about the film industry and have the film industry in it."</span></span></span></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><span><span><span>"I think that was the last of the films where we were like a big happy family and also let me tell you that they did not have managers or PRs then to make our lives difficult. I would just make one call and meet them and they would come on board. Of course, Shah Rukh Khan also had tremendous goodwill but I think it will be really difficult for someone to do it today. Then I just met people and they sweetly agreed. Salman </span></span></span><span><span><span>toh</span></span><span><span> I did not have to meet, he was like '</span></span><span><span>tu</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>mereko</span></span><span><span> time bol main aa </span></span><span><span>jaounga</span></span></span><span><span><span>'."</span></span></span></p><p><img alt title width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/Dee.jpg></p><p><span><span><span>But do you think the same can be recreated by the younger generation actors?</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Farah promptly replies, "I don't know. I think the younger generation is&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>very cynical. I was telling someone that maybe they won't have great fights and great enmities but there won't be great friendships either. I mean they are nice and all but I </span></span></span><span><span><span>don't</span></span></span><span><span><span> think they share the camaraderie which we see in Om Shanti Om."</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Talking about Deewangi song, how was it shooting for the song and having superstars like Salman Khan, Shah Rukh, Saif Ali Khan, Sanjay Dutt, all of them together?</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Farah laughs, "That day no one went home after their shot was over. Normally people want to run but they all stayed back for Dharam </span></span></span><span><span><span>ji's</span></span></span><span><span><span> shot. They waited for 3-4 hours and they jumped into the shot. When you see that scene and Salman dancing in that was not planned, he had jumped in from behind the camera and danced."</span></span></span></p><p><img alt title width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/Screenshot%2520%25284487%2529.png></p><p><span><span><span>She further added, "It was lovely, I was having a party for 6 days. But you know, it is the most difficult song that I have done. It looks easy but it took me almost a week to script it and who will come first and second and who should come in the final, at what point should we introduce a Dharamji or Mithun Da or a Kajol. All that took a lot of thought."</span></span></span></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><span><span><span>"The challenge was more regarding the logistic thing. When they see the song they shouldn't feel ki </span></span></span><span><span><span>arey</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>mera</span></span><span><span> cut </span></span><span><span>kia</span></span></span><span><span><span>. You know to give them [the actors] that respect and equal screen space was a challenge."&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5rFpLjUrKCvnaNksrmvy66qoq6VYn5xediemKurXaS6br%2FHmqWtoV2kum6x1Z6psqyZorJuv8ean2aqpaC1brfHmqVmr5%2BquaV50Z6kqK6VYrWqv4ysn6KqpGKxtr7Ip55mnJGnsW6xjJ2grJufYsCwusY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./acne-menstrual-tratamiento-cremas.html><span>←</span><span>5 cremas para ayudar a tu piel</span></a>
