The Sports Illustrated model is notorious for saying (or <a href=#>tweeting</a>!) exactly what’s on her mind and she recently got honest about why she won’t divorce her hubby.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> about why divorce is not an option in her 10-year relationship, the mom of Luna joked, “I told him the No. 1 reason we are not getting divorced is because I refuse to see another woman with my baby.” Even though we know she was partially joking, we’re sure there’s some truth behind her statement. And honestly, do you blame her? She has a beautiful family.</p><p>Chrissy might love to poke fun at John but she’s the first one to admit what a great husband and father he is. “I try to deprecate him because he’s so perfect,” she continued. “I got very, very lucky… I don’t know who else could put up with all the s–t we are constantly dealing with. Kids, friends, and work are hard, but John is the easiest part of everything.”</p><p>Chrissy recently opened up about her battle with postpartum depression and how John was her rock through that trying process. They both struggled through what she called a “dark” time but were able to come out as a stronger couple. And now, they’re looking forward to growing their family even more!</p><p>“I probably think about it more than anybody. I cannot wait to have the biggest family,” she <a href=#>said in a previous interview</a>. “Everybody is curious. They’re like, ‘When are you going to do it? When are you going to do it? When’s the process going to start?’” She even admitted that they will be welcoming a son next. The couple conceived Luna through IVF and have a male embryo as well. “Oh my God, a little boy is next for sure!” <a href=#>she gushed</a> earlier this year when asked if she wants a boy or another girl next.</p><p>John said that they’re ready to have their second baby “soon” explaining, “Hopefully we’ll have even more in the future.” And obviously, Chrissy can’t wait to add to their family as well. “How would I not want to expand my family with this beautiful person? He’s just everything.”</p><p>Click through the gallery below to see more adorable photos of Luna!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cn6uho6jGbsDEop6epl2fvKm6jKWcoJ2emXq4u81mq2acmau8s6%2FEZmhtamZogXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./category.html><span>←</span><span>Behind the Scenes: The Craftsmanship of Celebrity Jewellery Designers</span></a>
