I mean, this is probably one of the most daring female performances in decades, in a sense,” the actor said. “It’s just the kind of fearlessness that she has and a presence, and I mean presence with you as an actor,” he continued. “She’s just right there, no matter what you do she goes with you. And she’s a great talent.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Stone recently shared her thoughts on her Hollywood journey at the Palm Springs Awards, where she received the prestigious Desert Palm Achievement Award. Addressing some “totally garbage” advice she received as a teenager, Stone dismissed sexist notions about aging in the industry. “When I first moved to L.A., I went to one of those general meetings that they sometimes send you to, and an executive told me that for male actors, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. And in his eyes, for women, it was a sprint, not a marathon. And that was 20 years ago,” she said, per <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>.</p><p>She continued, “I realize that advice is total garbage because the majority of the women that I look up to in this industry, many of whom are in this room, have proven that as time goes on, life and work only get more interesting and more fulfilling.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-to-watch-the-golden-globes-2024-live-for-free>How to watch the Golden Globes 2024 live for free</h2><p>The Golden Globes airs on CBS, which is available to stream on services like <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>DirecTV Stream</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Fubo</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Paramount Plus</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Hulu+ With Live TV</a>.
