The fact that she used backup dancers on her Prismatic Tour that seem to be caricatures&nbsp;of black women’s bodies. Surprising coming from someone like Perry, who—on the&nbsp;&nbsp;other side of the spectrum—is known for music with generally empowering messages like&nbsp;self-acceptance anthem “Firework” and pro-women tune “Roar.”</p><p>Here, we take a look at the four performances that caused the most controversy. Take a look and let us know if you find these numbers&nbsp;offensive.</p><p><strong>1. Her Geisha-themed performance</strong><br>Katy opened the 2013 American Music Awards dressed as a geisha while singing her then-new single&nbsp;“Unconditionally,” in an act that featured&nbsp;cherry blossoms, a Shinto shrine and taiko drummers. Some rightfully thought it was racist to dress up as the&nbsp;traditional Japanese female figure who’s paid to serve and entertain while singing a song called “Unconditionally.”</p><p><strong>2. Her satan-themed performance of “Dark Horse”<br></strong>At the 2014 Grammy Awards, Perry caused controversy when she performed&nbsp;“Dark Horse”&nbsp;to what some thought was&nbsp;a&nbsp;satanic theme, complete with crosses, hellfire and broomsticks. Apparently, the song is about witchcraft, kinda.&nbsp;“It’s kind of a juxtaposition,” she explained to MTV News of the song. “It’s got me, a pop artist … and the lyrics are kind of witchy and dark, as if I was a witch warning this man not to fall in love with me, and if you do know I’m going to be your last.”</p><p><strong>3. Her Jewish impersonation</strong><br>In April, <a title="Katy Perry is Unrecognizable as an Old Woman in New ‘Birthday’ Video" href=#>Katy teased her latest music video “Birthday,”</a>&nbsp;in which the pop star morphs into a parade of the “world’s worst birthday party entertainers” including&nbsp;an old woman, a clown, and others. However, she also impersonated a fictional Jewish entertainer named&nbsp;Yusef Shalom that rankled some folks.&nbsp;Perry dressed in a&nbsp;a stereotypical afro, a yarmulke&nbsp;and a dated mustache, saying: “I am a birthday party entertainer, I do Bar mitzvahs, I do weddings … did you hear about the rabbi who did free circumcisions? He only did it for tips.” Sorry, not cool.</p><p><strong>4. Her faceless big-booty&nbsp;dancers&nbsp;</strong><br>Photos of Perry’s Prismatic Tour began making the rounds on Twitter, and some show the singer surrounded by faceless backup dancers with&nbsp;exaggerated lips, dark hair, hoop earrings and long nails, all in seriously padded bodysuits. <a href=# rel=nofollow>As Jezebel pointed out</a>, it’s hard to know what the intention was exactly, but it sure does look&nbsp;like hypersexualized caricatures of black women’s bodies.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/Awkward_Duck/status/476166712682110976</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB%2Bk21qbGpfoK61xYypnKuqqWK%2Foq%2FIrKtmp5absq%2B%2FyK%2BcZqiVp7OwvsyapZydo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eve-best.html><span>←</span><span>Eve BestBiography</span></a>
