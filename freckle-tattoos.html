Alright, we made that up, but it seems to be the rampant sentiment as of late, with every new, emerging beauty trend being some form of tattoo (lookin’ at you, microblading). And now, it appears that the latest trend to hit social media is freckle tattooing. Yup.

According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>NewBeauty</a>, who interviewed cosmetic tattoo artists <a href=# rel=nofollow>Gabrielle Rainbow</a> on the trend, the freckling process (which, at her shop, can cost about $250) generally takes about an hour to do, with results lasting up to three years.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kosas-brow-nano-pop-review.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tattooplacementmeaning.png><p>“When [the freckles] are ‘freshly done,’ they will appear swollen, almost like bee stings,” said Rainbow, noting that the swelling does go down after a few hours, and the intense color will soften after a few months. And, after a few years, the spots will fade away, leaving you with your natural-born skin again. Of course, we feel the need to remind you that these are still <a href=# id=auto-tag_tattoos data-tag=tattoos>tattoos</a> on your face, and that there’s no turning back once you get them done.</p><p>Still, if you’re in love with your freckles (which you should be!) and want to enhance them, or want the spent-all-summer-in-the-sun look without the skin cancer, tattooed freckles could be the way to go. Just, like, think really hard about it first, and find a reputable tattoo artist who won’t make you look like you’re suddenly covered in blackheads.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2huZmiBdH2On6mem5uhsm7AwK2rqKejZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-elizabeths-buckingham-palace-gin-sold-out-8-hours.html><span>←</span><span>Queen Elizabeths Buckingham Palace Gin sold out in 8 hours but will Meghan Markle be sent a b</span></a>
