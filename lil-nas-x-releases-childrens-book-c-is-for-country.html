And feathers. And fake fur. I love that for me," reads an illustrated Nas in a sneak peak from a page of the book. Another page shows Nas brushing his pony Panini, while the text reads, "P is for Panini. Night night, little pony."</p><p>Flipping to one of the last pages Nas says, "S is for swag. Just 'cause I'm going to bed doesn't mean I can't look good!" For the last preview it shows Nas posed up with his family as the text reads, "T is for thankful. I love my fam!"</p><p>Random House also revealed some of the text from the first few pages of the book: "A is for adventure. Every day is a brand-new start! B is for boots—whether they're big or small, short or tall. And C is for country."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:859aca9c-0cd8-4968-bf2c-10e0f78b1cee data-container-ref=toofab:article:20883153-f782-44db-a4e1-3d2258f599b6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a1/5by4/2020/12/02/a1239744dd8a44d3884517c58fdf871e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Warner Bros.</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lil Nas X Reveals First Celebrity Crush During Ellen's Burning Questions</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Join superstar Lil Nas X—who boasts the longest-running #1 song in history—and Panini the pony on a joyous journey through the alphabet from sunup to sundown," the publisher continued to describe the book on its website.
