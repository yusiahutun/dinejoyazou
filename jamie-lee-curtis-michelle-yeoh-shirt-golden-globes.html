"#FRIENDSSUPPORTINGFRIENDS is a perfect squad goal for 2023. Thank you Erin and all who are expanding it and amplifying the message and CONGRATULATIONS @michelleyeoh_official YOU ARE EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE!"</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Yeoh later took to her own Instagram to post a photo of herself holding up her own "friends supporting friends" shirt.</p><p>"Love you @jamieleecurtis!!" she wrote in the caption, wishing Curtis well wishes following her COVID-19 diagnosis.

"40 years, not letting go of this. It's been an amazing journey and incredible fight to be here today, but I think it's been worth it."</p><p>"As time went by -- I turned 60 last year and I think all of you women understand this -- as the days, the years and the numbers get bigger, it seems like opportunities start to get smaller as well," said Yeoh, admitting there came a time where she thought to herself, "You had a really good run."</p><a id=gallery-link-cfd86eb9-4e8c-4180-be6a-2779600b072c class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:cfd86eb9-4e8c-4180-be6a-2779600b072c data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:2aae25d5-1340-4bdc-9128-004d22b4f40f data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8d/4by3/2023/01/11/8d2b2ac8b57e457887e391da074da1ff_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmam5fn66utcRmo56dXZjCs8DIrGSmoZOdsq24xGawnqeYYsCptdGtZKCnnJmyr3nGpaabnaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-marsden-divorce-lisa-linde-x-men-star-enjoy-family-day-son-jack-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>James Marsden divorce: Lisa Linde and X Men star enjoy family day out with son Jack</span></a>
