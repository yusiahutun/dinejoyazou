News of her death was confirmed by radio station KKFI-FM via a social media post where Lopez-Galvan hosted the “Taste of Tejano” radio show as a volunteer. According to <a href=#><span>The Kansas City Star</span></a>, Lopez-Galvan was undergoing surgery for an abdominal gunshot wound and succumbed to her injuries. She was 43.</p><p>“This senseless act has taken a beautiful person from her family and this KC Community. She is a person who added a voice that is oftentimes missed. We can speak as much as we can, but words don’t do this justice, don’t do her justice. So much sadness. So much devastation and just an incredible loss. … She just went down there to have some fun,” stated Kelly Dougherty, KKFI director of development and communications.</p><p>The <a href=#><span>mass shooting</span></a> occurred Wednesday (February 14) at Kansas City’s Union Station during a parade and rally celebrating the Chief’s repeat Super Bowl win. Lopez-Galvan, her daughter Adriana, her son Marc, and her husband Mike were in attendance with other family members and an estimated 1 million other fans. The celebration turned somber when gunfire rang out not far from where the team and some players were still on the stage, mingling after the official rally had ended. Lopez-Galvan became one of the 19 people treated for gunshot wounds and the only fatality, according to <a href=#><span>Kansas City Fire Chief Ross Grundyson</span></a>.</p><p>“We are heartbroken with the loss of our loved one, Elizabeth ‘Lisa’ Lopez-Galvan, who was an amazing mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend to so many,” the Lopez-Galvan family said in a statement. Three other family members, including Lopez-Galvan’s son, were injured, the family told <a href=#><span>CNN</span></a>.</p><p>“Lisa leaves behind her husband of 22 years, Mike, and two children, Marc and Adriana. We ask you to please keep our family in your prayers as we grieve the loss of Lisa’s death while also supporting our other loved ones who were impacted in this senseless act.”</p><p>In speaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Lopez-Galvan’s brother Beto Lopez said, “We have tragic situations like this one that occur unfortunately way too often, and a lot of time, individuals get lost as just statistics or numbers. She did a lot for this community and the Kansas City area, raising money for a lot of charitable events and organizations, and it’s something we’ll be very proud of forever. She was a very loving, caring and devoted mother.”</p><p>According to Beto, Lopez-Galvan came from three generations of musicians in the family and carried on her family’s legacy. She worked as a bilingual private DJ for over 15 years before becoming a co-host of “A Taste of Tejano” in March 2022. “Music is life and a source of happiness,” she wrote in her KKFI biography.</p><p>Stephanie Meyer, Children Mercy Hospital’s Chief Nursing Officer, reported to <a href=#><span>CNN</span></a> they received 12 patients following the tragedy, 11 children and 1 adult, with nine of the children suffering gunshot wounds.</p><p>Two juveniles have been charged in connection with the shooting. They were taken into custody after the parade, charged on Thursday (February 15) and are being held at a juvenile detention center on gun-related and resisting-arrest charges, the Jackson County Family Court Division of the 16th Judicial Circuit Court of Missouri said in a statement.&nbsp;Additional charges are expected as the police investigation continues.</p><p>“I am grateful for the charges against the two juveniles who hurt innocent people, simultaneously scarring an entire community,” Kansas City police Chief Stacey Graves said in a statement posted on social media.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>A statement from Chief Stacey Graves regarding the Super Bowl celebration charges. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/s8YcgVacmT</a></p><p>— kcpolice (@kcpolice) <a href=#>February 16, 2024</a></p><p>A <a href=#><span><strong>GoFundMe</strong></span></a> page surpassing $348,000 has been established to support the Lopez-Galvan family. Global superstar Taylor Swift, in a relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, made two $50,000 donations, writing, “Sending my deepest sympathies and condolences in the wake of your devastating loss. Love, Taylor Swift.”</p><p>Kelce also made two $50,000 donations under his foundation, The Eight-Seven and Running Foundation, to another family affected that day. A <a href=#><span><strong>GoFundMe</strong> </span></a>was set up to benefit the Reyes family, whose two young daughters were shot, to aid in their mental and financial recovery. It currently stands at over $193,000.</p><p>“I will not let her death go in vain. I will legislate, I will fight, and I will do everything in my power to change this State and City for the better,” vowed Manny Abarca, a Jackson County legislator.</p><p>In honoring Lopez-Galvan, the community stands united against gun violence, ensuring her vibrant spirit lives on through the music she shared and the lives she touched.
