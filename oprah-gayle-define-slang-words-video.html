Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King's slang knowledge has been put to the test.
For the latest episode of OprahMag.com's series &#34;The OG Chronicles,&#34; everyone's favorite BFFs were asked to define slang words and phrases commonly used by millennials and Gen Z, including &#34;thirst trap,&#34; &#34;wig snatched,&#34; &#34;shade,&#34; &#34;lit&#34; and many others. Not only did they have to define the word, but they also had to use it in a sentence."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Not only did they have to define the word, but they also had to use it in a sentence.</p><p>As you would expect from the iconic duo, it was absolutely hilarious.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b9f37146-2e36-527a-8619-76c90cd63ea4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6437b288-d45c-5cc7-ae34-f189bd476435 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=33><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ce/5by4/2019/06/25/ceb98a21c76f5162890914e55e48e58e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Everything Rosie O'Donnell Said About Whoopi, Oprah, Roseanne, Elisabeth, Madonna, 'The Talk' and More</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I'm thinking we know it pretty well, what do you think," Gayle asked and Oprah answered, "I don't think I do...and I don't care if I don't either. You can't 'slang-shame' me." Gayle, on the other hand, said, "Well, I want to be up to date, so let's go!"</p><p>The ladies guessed the first two slang words -- "lit" and "shade" -- correctly right off the bat. However, they were stumped by the term "snack."</p><p>"My favorite snack is barbecue potato chips," Gayle said and Oprah added, "And mine is popcorn with truffles."</p><p>After learning the correct definition -- "someone who looks really good at the moment" -- Oprah teased she spent some time with a "snack" lately, but sadly didn't spill the tea.</p><p>"Oh, I just had lunch with somebody who's a real snack," she said. "I'm not gonna say who it is either. He was more than a snack. That was a meal!"</p><p>Gayle and Oprah nailed the definitions of "secure the bag," "shook" and <a href=#><strong>Cardi B's</strong></a> unofficially trademarked phrase, "OKURRR," but were once again stumped with the phrase "wig snatched." The "CBS This Morning" host and "Wrinkle in Time" star couldn't agree on whether the term was a compliment or a diss.</p><p>However, Gayle absolutely knocked it out of the park with her definition of "thirst trap."</p><p>"Thirst is not a good thing," she said. "It's like they're seeking attention all the time. So if somebody's thirsty, that means they want attention, and they will do anything they can to get it -- so a thirst trap is not a good thing."</p><p>See how the ladies attempted to define all of the slang words and phrases -- which also included "receipts," "thicc," "clapback" and "JOMO" -- in the full video above!</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
