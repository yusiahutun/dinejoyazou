And based on this rule, that means the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>2000s are back and thriving</a>. The resurgence of these trends isn't always exactly how you remember, though. Instead, they marry trends from the past and present to feel more fashionable and less, well, cringey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This rule relates to beauty as well. Just take a look at some of the trends going viral today—<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>thin eyebrows</a>, very glossy lips, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>chunky highlights</a>. Naturally, Y2K beauty extends to hairstyling, too. From spiky buns to zigzag parts and baby braids, 2000s hairstyles are having their moment in the limelight, and we're kind of into it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're still on the fence about the resurgence of 2000s beauty, though, allow us to ease you into it. Ahead, check out some of the most popular Y2K hairstyles that are back, better than ever, and worth a try.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-face-framing-updos></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Face-Framing Updos</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Roc Nation</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Remember whenever we would wear a bun or ponytail, we would take out two random, thin pieces of hair from the front of our heads to resemble bangs? Well, bangs or not, these thin face-framing strands are making a comeback once again, and the thinner, the better.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-beaded-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Beaded Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beaded braids, seen here on Halle Bailey, are very much giving us <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alicia Keys</a> circa 2009 — think Fallin' music video (although they've been around for way longer). We love how the beads add an additional accessory to the hair and outfit.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-spiky-buns></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Spiky Buns</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Letting the ends of your hair stick out of your updo to give it that spiky look was such a big trend in the 2000s. You can tone this hairstyle up or down depending on how much hair you want to show from your bun.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-baby-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Baby Braids</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Toni Anne Barson/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two small, baby braids at the front of your head aren't just easy to create but also highlight your face and hair in the best way. Ten out of 10 recommend it on days when you need a quick and easy style.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-claw-clip-buns></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Claw Clip Buns</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Claw clip hairstyles</a> are having a huge moment right now. The clips themselves are now available in so many different colors and designs, it makes it that much more fun to style. From a messy bun to a half-up-half-down look, they offer so much versatility.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-butterfly-clips></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Butterfly Clips</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of hair clips, butterfly clips are back and aren't reserved for any specific age group, like what you might once remember. Celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">Dua Lipa</a>, Meg the Stallion, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noreferrer noopener">Bella Hadid</a> are all leaning into this trend and looking good doing it. Get creative with your butterfly clips for a fun and playful look.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pigtails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pigtails</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bring on the nostalgia by wearing any iteration of pigtails. From small ones that live on the top of your head to styling all of your hair up in two ponytails as a nod to Baby Spice, we're seeing it all.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-flicked-ends></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Flicked Ends</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The next time you heat style your hair, create a dramatic flip at the ends for a glamorous hairstyle. Whether you wear your hair completely out or put it up in a half-up half-down style, you can't go wrong. Bonus points if you add those face-framing pieces at the front.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-crimped-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Crimped Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like the start of most beauty trends these days, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>#mermaidwaves went viral on TikTok</a> recently with over eight million views. Despite the new name, the zig-zag waves that lay in uniform were originally known as crimped hair in the 2000s. While the waves this time around may be a little wider than in the past, as seen here on Gigi Hadid, there's no denying it takes inspiration from the original style.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-zig-zag-part></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Zig-Zag Part</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For those who want to commit to the throwback vibes, zig-zag parts are becoming increasingly popular on TikTok and amongst celebrities to which all we have to say is, don't knock it 'til you try it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK572GuiZqCRnr%2B0wNilnKxlZWiEd4GVbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-jessica-parker-on-wearing-heels.html><span>←</span><span>'I've Asked a Lot of My Feet'</span></a>
