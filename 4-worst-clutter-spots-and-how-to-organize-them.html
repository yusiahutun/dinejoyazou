Whether it’s out of sight in a&nbsp;junk drawer&nbsp;or slowly but surely taking over your kitchen bench, there’s nothing more satisfying than finally sitting down and sorting through the miscellaneous mess. Here we take a look at four common clutter hotspots and how to tackle them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Kitchen Counter</h2><p>We have a theory that a completely bare, totally uncluttered kitchen countertop is actually a myth — it’s up there with the Loch Ness monster and Donald Trump’s real hair. Have you ever seen any of these things?</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Thanks to an open-plan living and a trend toward huge islands that allow you to cook, entertain, and converse simultaneously, it’s safe to say the kitchen is now considered the hub of the home. Think of all the activities that take place at your kitchen counter: breakfast, coffee catch-ups, homework, life admin – the list goes on. So it’s not surprising that paperwork, school stuff, shopping lists, keys, handbags and more find themselves at home in this busy zone. But that’s not to say it’s OK. Claim back your kitchen counter and keep the hub of your home neat and tidy by simply keeping a basket nearby for all the random stuff that seems to accumulate there, and, as part of your evening <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="clean up (opens in a new tab)" href=#>clean up</a>, return all items to their “forever homes.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Bathroom</h2><p>Towels and clothes all over the floor, makeup on the counter, and the shower cluttered with products — whose bathroom&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;a magnet for clutter? First, make it a habit to hang up towels after use.&nbsp;Every time.&nbsp;If you need to, invest in extra wall hooks or back-of-door hooks to make sure there’s enough space for them. Then, get a large basket (with a lid) for dirty clothes. Work to ensure all your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="products (opens in a new tab)" href=#>products</a> have a home.&nbsp;Storage baskets&nbsp;are good for holding products and they come in various sizes so they work everywhere. In the shower, a corner caddy offers ample storage for all those bottles. If you want to get rid of bottles altogether, soap dispensers could be the answer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Bedside Table</h2><p>Books, teacups, phone chargers — if your bedside table is anything like mine, it needs some serious&nbsp;decluttering. First: have a two-book maximum rule. The rest of your stack needs to find a home elsewhere. Second, hang some&nbsp;wall pockets&nbsp;above your table — they’re great for keeping small items, like jewelry and glasses, off your table.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Front Door</h2><p>Ah, the front door. A dumping ground for shoes, bags, mail… everything, really. First, you need a storage solution, like a shoe rack or cupboard. Under this, install a few baskets for your handbags, schoolbags, scarves and so on. And don’t forget an umbrella bucket — store your umbrella and yoga mat there.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>And a Few More Decluttering Tips</h2><ul><li>Try not to put something down on a flat surface unless it lives there.</li><li>File your mail immediately (and recycle the envelopes/junk mail).</li><li>Invest in hooks&nbsp;everywhere. They can eliminate so much floor and surface clutter.</li><li>Storage baskets make it easy to corral clutter in every room in your home. You can never have enough.&nbsp;</li><li>Regularly making time to declutter your home – even if it’s just one room each month – will help you keep on top of things.&nbsp;</li><li>The biggest single thing you can do to improve the look of your home is to get things out of it. Make a habit of purging unwanted, unused or broken belongings.</li></ul><p>This article originally appeared on our sister site, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Homes to Love</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJon6illWSBbsPOq6qtZZOhwrXAxKtkrKifqcBurc2dZKGnp2LBsHnOq56appmvsm7Ax56k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./purdue-begins-prove-it-mission-plucky-grambling-state-unbowed.html><span>←</span><span>Purdue begins prove-it mission, plucky Grambling State unbowed | National</span></a>
