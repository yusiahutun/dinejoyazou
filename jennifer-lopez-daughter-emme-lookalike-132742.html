"We don’t have a normal life, I don’t have normal kids," she previously said of her family. "I’m not normal. So our life is not normal. I’ve come to terms with that."</p><p>"They are super happy, well-adjusted, loving, caring kids, and that’s the most important thing," the star continued. "The most important thing is that they’re with their mom — that they don’t feel abandoned by a parent. I want to be there with them. I don’t want to miss [anything], it’s gonna go so fast!"</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Jennifer Lopez Loves Wearing No Makeup — See Her Best Bare-Faced Pics!</a></p><p>However, she recently admitted that sometimes she's so busy that <a href=#>her kids have to schedule in quality time with her</a>! "You know, they're always first. When you put them first, then everybody else understands the hierarchy," she said. "My son said to me this week, he goes, 'Mom, I'd like to schedule… a picnic with you this week cause I know you've been, you know, working hard. He was with me in New York, but still, he was like 'Um I'd like to schedule a picnic for next Friday because we need more quality time.' And I was like, 'Okay baby.'"
