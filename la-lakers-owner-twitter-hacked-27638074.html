Hello twitter family i have 3 #PS5 For sale for you guys! DM me to purchase!”, it read. “All proceeds will go directly towards charity and everyone that purchases one will have the chance to attend a lakers game.”</p><p>Just two hours after that tweet was posted, using Buss’ position as Lakers chairman, another one was added with an extra incentive to purchase the final console. “Got 1 more #PS5 Left last Person that purchases it will get flown out to personally have lunch with the #Lakers Family!,” the enthusiastic message read. As of writing, the tweets have yet to be deleted.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Real Madrid chief's ambitions for "new Bernabeu" include NBA "dream" and tennis record</a></b></p><p>Fans commented on the bizarre post, with user @CookedbySteph referencing the Lakers’ struggles last season. “Lakers are such a mess even the owner of the team got hacked,” they wrote, while Lakers fan page @LakersGlobal warned: “ Hacked, do not engage.”</p><p>User @Toronto_Roadman then joked: “Them Lakers pulling all the stops to keep Lebron,” while @BigTG559 said: “Co-owner of the most recognisable NBA franchise and she gets her s**t hacked by a scammer selling PS5’s.”</p><p>Before her days as an NBA team owner, Buss decided to pose nude in "Playboy" in May 1995. When she opted to participate in the photoshoot 27 years ago, Buss achieved a personal goal.</p><p>"When I posed, I was 32 years old," Buss said. "It wasn't like I was making a mistake that I didn't know what I was getting myself into. For me, I was at the maturity level that I could do it. And I was like every other model, I had to go through the test photo shoot and all that kind of stuff. It was my own personal goal, not anything to do with business or anything. Just something I wanted to do."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27638235.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1158138059.jpg><p>Now in her sixties, she says even almost three decades later, she still has to defend her decision to feature in the magazine. “I’m still explaining it 20 years later," she said. “They want to judge and put me in a category.”</p><p>She also credited her late father and former Lakers owner Jerry for how he handled her decision to do the shoot.</p><p>"My dad is again one of the most brilliant people," she said. "He gave a quote that was so perfect, where he said, 'It will be the first issue of Playboy magazine I've never read.'</p><p>"Meaning, he's endorsing the magazine, but I'm his daughter, right. He can walk that fine line of not being judgmental or putting me down."</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Billionaire Michael Jordan snubs kids as viral footage leaves NBA fans split</a></p></li><li><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>NBA star Klay Thompson goes 'full Jack Grealish' in Warriors' Championship celebrations</a></p></li><li><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Steph Curry’s mega net worth saw NBA star buy £25m mansion next to WhatsApp founder</a></p></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27253423><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|Image aria-label="NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal pays insane restaurant tab for entire restaurant while on date" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27253423><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27253879.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_STATONEIL.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27253879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_STATONEIL.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27253423>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal pays insane restaurant tab for entire restaurant while on date</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27148578><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|Image aria-label="Giant basketball player was almost as tall as hoop - but height stopped him making NBA" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27148578><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27148387.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Robert-Bobroczky-a-7-foot-7-teen-from-Romania.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27148578>Giant basketball player was almost as tall as hoop - but height stopped him making NBA</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e86tn56qXai9sL7TrGalmV2hrqyx0axkqK%2Bemr9uwNaiq62domK1oq%2FKnptmamdrgHl8lm0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-alvin-kamara-and-girlfriend-tea-coopers-dating-history.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Alvin Kamara And Girlfriend Tea Coopers Dating History</span></a>
