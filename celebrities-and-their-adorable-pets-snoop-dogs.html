The cute canine friend followed Rocky, the former Border Terrier of the family who sadly died five years ago at the age of 12. The new pup famously chewed his passport whilst on a trip to Costa del Sol with the 60-year-old; luckily Angus was given a Spanish passport to allow him back home to the UK, meaning he has dual nationality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/64fc36bf22a9-rochell-and-marvin-humes-dog-a.jpg><h2>Rochelle and Marvin Humes</h2><p id=eWH_MR0yL92G>Rochelle and Marvin revealed the new addition to the Humes household in February 2019, Ginger, a cross between a Cocker Spaniel and a poodle.
