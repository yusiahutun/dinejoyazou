But their made-to-measure <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Tailor Me</a> service&nbsp;option is a lot of fun for those with a spot of creativity and the desire&nbsp;to create a suit that can be worn again and again.

I opted to visit their Oxford Street store to get a bit of help - and discovered that while the choices are endless, the process was simple to use whilst giving a huge variety of options which means you can have a totally unique suit that feels as personal as the bride's wedding dress decision.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/97d5b4fe7c97-suit-swatches-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=en5p2F1vX3Vu data-wc=7><strong>The options to choose from are endless</strong></p><p id=eXwGgTHoysOp data-wc=83>From choosing your material for the suit and lining, right through to whether I wanted belt loops or braces this was&nbsp;a really complete service that left nothing out. There were parts of the suit that I could personalise that I didn't even know existed - from buttons, to lapel width, vents, stitching - you name it, it's customisable!&nbsp;Moss Bros even have little touches like being able to put messages into the jacket&nbsp;to mark a special day. A really nice touch.</p><p id=ekQ2NfjgZiQM><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: 10 of the most dapper celebrity and royal grooms and groomsmen</a></p><p id=eGvKd6IBKw3T data-wc=93>The fitting process was really quick and easy, they used shop floor suits to find a size close to me and then pinned the suit to get my exact size before measuring it up and sending it off to be made. My first real fitting was a few weeks later and I was expecting there to be adjustments needed, but the suit fitted perfectly. It was the first time I had seen more than just the swatch material and I was instantly relieved that what I had chosen was exactly what I wanted.</p><p id=e0DEO4vH-OgV data-wc=82>There were staff on hand to help give advice on if any alterations were needed but&nbsp;I could tell straight away it was right. The staff that I encountered throughout the process were unbelievably helpful and were there for all of my many questions. I couldn't be happier with the suit. It fits perfectly, you can really tell the difference between off the shelf and one that's made just for me.&nbsp;I feel like I have something really unique for my wedding.</p><p id=eC8Ib1eattEl data-wc=25><strong>Planning your wedding?
