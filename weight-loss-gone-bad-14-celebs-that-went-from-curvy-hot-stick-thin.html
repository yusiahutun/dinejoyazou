Not a day goes by that we don’t see<a href=#>&nbsp;LiLo in the tabloids&nbsp;</a>for one thing or another, so it’s no wonder she felt so much pressure to be thin after her initial success. (The girl has also struggles from severe drug and alcohol abuse, which doesn’t help matters.) Lately, however, she seems to have put a few more pounds back onto her fame, but she’s nowhere near as curvaceous as she once was.</p><p><strong><img decoding=async title alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a.sccdn.net/size/486x/news/89639_1268345572.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong></p><p><strong>2. <a href=# id=auto-tag_hilary-swank data-tag=hilary-swank>Hilary Swank</a><br></strong>Back in 2004, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Oscar-winning actress&nbsp;</a>was toned to perfection—she hit the gym hard in order to play the role of a tough boxer in “Million Dollar Baby” and it showed. Since then, Swank has not only lost her muscles, but she’s also gone through a divorce from her husband, Chad Lowe. Could the <a href=# id=auto-tag_weight-loss data-tag=weight-loss>weight loss</a> have something to do with the stress of her marriage ending? Judging from this picture of her (above) from&nbsp;Vanity Fairs 2010 Academy Awards after-party, she looks like a shadow of her former self.</p><p><strong><img decoding=async title alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a.sccdn.net/size/486x/news/89635_1268345556.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong></p><p><strong>3. Jennifer Connolly<br></strong>In 2010, the media talked incessantly about Jennifer’s excessive weight loss. She’s since said that her thin frame was due to the strain caused by her father’s death.</p><p><strong><a href=#><img decoding=async title alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a.sccdn.net/size/486x/news/89636_1268345558.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></strong></p><p><strong>4. Kristin Cavallari</strong><br><a href=#>The&nbsp;“Laguna Beach” and “The Hills”&nbsp;star</a>&nbsp;started out thin and fit, and in 2010 started to look thinner than usual. Last year, she gave birth to a baby boy, adding a few more curves back to her petite frame.</p><p><strong><img decoding=async title alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a.sccdn.net/size/486x/news/89638_1268345568.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong></p><p><strong>5. <a href=# id=auto-tag_kate-bosworth data-tag=kate-bosworth>Kate Bosworth</a></strong><br>During her “Blue Crush”&nbsp;days, Bosworths body was definitely something to be envied. Things are a little different now, as Bosworth has been looking decidedly skinny during the past couple of years, likely because of her fairly newfound fashion It-girl status.</p><p><strong><a href=#><img decoding=async title alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a.sccdn.net/size/486x/news/89644_1268345955.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></strong></p><p><strong>6. Ashlee Simpson</strong><br>After her highly&nbsp;<a href=#>publicized nose job</a>&nbsp;in 2006, Simpson underwent a full body makeover. She changed everything, from her hair color to her weight, which plummeted rapidly. Ashlee has always been the smaller of the Simpson sisters, so it was shocking when she dropped even more weight. Luckily, with the help of a pregnancy, Simpson has been able to put back on some much-needed pounds</p><p><strong><img decoding=async title alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a.sccdn.net/size/486x/news/89633_1268345544.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong></p><p><strong>7. <a href=# id=auto-tag_christina-ricci data-tag=christina-ricci>Christina Ricci</a></strong><br>Christina Ricci is no stranger to weight struggles: The actress has admitted to battling anorexia in her teens, yet her weight often fluctuates and appears dangerously low.</p><p><strong><a href=#><img decoding=async title alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a.sccdn.net/size/486x/news/89631_1268345539.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></strong></p><p><strong>8. Renee Zellweger</strong><br>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Bridget Jones’ Diary&nbsp;actress&nbsp;</a>is a veritable expert in gaining and losing weight—she’s been doing it for years. It seems like every time she has to gain weight for a role, she ends up losing double the amount when production ends. She has yet to find a happy medium. If we had to choose, wed go with curvy over skinny Rene any day.</p><p><strong><img decoding=async title alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a.sccdn.net/size/486x/news/89641_1268345581.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong><strong></strong></p><p><strong>9. Nikki Cox</strong><br>Remember the days when Nikki Cox used to be considered&nbsp;<a href=#>a serious sex symbol</a>? In the ’90s, the actress regularly got cast as the hot It-girl. Sadly, these days, her scarily skinny body is becoming increasingly hard to look at. Plus, her once ample chest is now nothing but skin and bones.</p><p><strong><img decoding=async title alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a.sccdn.net/size/486x/news/89642_1268345590.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong></p><p><strong>10. Keira Knightley</strong><br>The “Pirates of the Caribbean”&nbsp;star always seems to garner attention because of her skinny frame. &nbsp;In fact, the last time that we can recall seeing a curvier Knightley was in her 2003 film “Bend it Like Beckham.” (The actress, who played the role of a soccer star, had a noticeably more athletic body back then.) Knightley has been very vocal about the fact that both her grandmother and great-grandmother suffered from anorexia, but maintains that she hasn’t followed in their footsteps.</p><p><strong><a href=#><img decoding=async title alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a.sccdn.net/size/486x/news/89637_1268345563.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></strong><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2idnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pfHiEkWpmsJ2ZnLW1ecuoqqxll6S7pnnBmptmaWRisKa4xJuqZqyYlsFuw8Snq2aeoqS6bq%2FUq62yZZikwW6%2F06KapGWknbavew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-sex-toys-older-women.html><span>←</span><span>Best Sex Toys For Women Who Never Bought Adult Toys Before</span></a>
