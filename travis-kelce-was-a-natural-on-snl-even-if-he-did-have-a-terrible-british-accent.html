The <a href=#>celebrity</a> has been on the small screen before, with his <a href=#>E! dating show, Catching Kelce</a>, which didn’t really take off. He didn’t find the ‘one’ through the Bachelor-style series, but that doesn’t matter now as he’s dating <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>. However, after his awkward series, he asked his managers to get him a spot on <a href=#>SNL</a> – and Travis Kelce’ wish came true (shame about that British accent though).</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-had-been-trying-to-get-on-snl-for-years>Travis had been trying to get on SNL for years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-15.43.31-1024x524.png><p>His managers, twin brothers Aaron and Andrew Eanes, have been representing the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> star for more than a decade.</p><p>Aaron initially reached out to the show’s producers during the NFL season in 2020 but they weren’t too keen, but didn’t turn him down either.</p><p>Wanting to get the ball rolling, the now 34-year-old took advantage of an opportunity when he bumped into SNL creator and producer Lorne Michaels at one of the famous afterparties in 2021. Travis Kelce managed to ‘chat up’ the SNL boss, and made a great impression, which came through four months later.</p><p>After the Chiefs won their second Super Bowl rings, his management received a call from SNL inviting him to guest host.</p><p>Weeks after lifting the Vince Lombardi trophy, he was standing on the SNL stage giving his monologue, in front of parents Donna and Ed Kelce, as well as brother <a href=#>Jason</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-s-attempt-at-a-british-accent-in-hilarious-snl-clip>Travis Kelce’s attempt at a British accent in hilarious SNL clip</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-15.40.43-1024x561.png><p>One fan-favorite skit from the athlete’s time guest hosting the weekend comedy series was when they made fun of British dating show, Too Hot To Handle, where Travis Kelce played a character who kept being the reason the group’s cash prize was dwindling.</p><p>He seemed to not be able to keep his hands off another cast member, much to the other guests’ surprise.</p><p>And fans were pretty happy with his performance.</p><p>Considering Travis once divulged his <a href=#>dream job would be acting in a Wes Anderson film</a>, he could be in <a href=#>Hollywood</a> next.</p><p>One person wrote: “I’d never heard of this guy before seeing him on SNL but damn….he’s been a natural this entire weekend!”</p><p>A second said: “The commitment! He went above and beyond”</p><p>While a third Kelce fan quipped: “Even funnier knowing Travis was going for a British accent”</p><p>And someone else added: “Best football player host SNL has had in years. Travis was a natural all night. Salute.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-and-taylor-swift-s-cameo-after-they-started-dating>Travis’ and Taylor Swift’s ‘cameo’ after they started dating</h2><p>Now, they both actually made a surprise appearance in a skit in October 2023 too – a month after the <a href=#>music</a> star was spotted at Arrowhead Stadium.</p><p>For Taylor though, the appearance was more on how the skit was all about her and her Swifties, she didn’t get on the show. But she has hosted before, so she can share that with her beau Trav.</p><p>But Travis jumped at the chance to get back on.</p><p>In a clip called NFL’s Swiftmania, on October 18, he played someone who wanted to talk about football over Swift’s attendance at games – which was not what the football panel was doing.</p><p>He said to his brother Jason on their <a href=#>New Heights podcast</a> afterward: “I’ll tell you what, man, it was electric to be back in that place.</p><p>“There’s just something about being in that room, and just it being their first episode this season — I had such a freaking blast, man.”</p><p>“I didn’t know what the skit was, like what skits were coming up and I’m pretty sure that it was just ironic that they were doing a skit on… Swiftmania,” he said.</p><p>“I thought it was hilarious and when they asked me to be a part of it, I was like, ‘Man, I’d be honored.'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2aDcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGaumqtdlnqvrdOuqZqkXaS7br%2FNpWSerpWjeqqyjKGcZpyZmXqprdWeZJplpJq%2Fs7XBpZxmmqKewaq%2Fx2aYnJuVo8Fw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quentin-halys.html><span>←</span><span>Quentin Halys Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Wife, Net Worth</span></a>
