Visually it’s not the prettiest section to the eye. It’s grey and often, quite bland. Moreover, I can see how it might be perceived to have negatively impacted the pace of the story.</p><h2>Why is the Resident Evil 4 island important?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamebyte.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/40d8631b-resident-evil-4-regenerator.jpg><p>That being said, without the island, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> 4 would be less of a game, and I’m not talking about campaign length. Just a heads up, I will mention some <strong>spoilers </strong>here. However, we are talking about a 17-year-old game which was originally released in 2005.</p><p>The island section included the Regenerator/Iron Maiden enemy, which is considered to be one of the creepiest in the entire series. We also have the Krauser and U-3 boss fights. Oh, and Leon even gets to pose on a throne chair.</p><h2>We’ll surely meet the Iron Maiden again!</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamebyte.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a38b72d6-re4_ada_01.jpg><h2>RE4 includes two bonus campaigns</h2><p>Fans will also hope to see the additional bonus campaigns, Separate Ways and Assignment Ada appear in the remake. While Separate Ways features some of the island, Assignment Ada is based in that very location.</p><p>News of the island not being cut in the remake was shared by Twitter user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AestheticGamer</a> courtesy of Edge Magazine. Furthermore, not only will the island return in the remake but there will also be “a lot more of it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>(2/2) finished their section of the game, they came back together and went over each team's work for revisions & to focus on alterations for pacing.</p><p>But the devs mention the Island by name & say there's "A lot more to it" than the original game, but don't clarify any further.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href=#>January 1, 2023</a></figure><h2>When is the Resident Evil 4 remake release date?</h2><p>The Resident Evil 4 remake release date is just a few months away.
