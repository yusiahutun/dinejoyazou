In the opening episode, the young ladies at Margaret's brothel are even spotted excitedly reading their descriptions to one another.&nbsp;</p><p id=etCVNH5uK_-B data-wc=4><strong>WATCH: BBC's Harlots trailer</strong></p><p id=eBuXNKzP9sKL data-wc=99>Chatting to Radio Times, co-writer Alison Newman said that they "took bits from people that we found – that sounds awful, doesn’t it? We were inspired by them. We’ve borrowed – that’s a better word, isn’t it? – we’ve borrowed from real life a bit". Speaking about the directory, her fellow writer Moira Buffini explained: "It just opened up the door to a London that was so fascinating, and into a world which surprised us at every turn, in not just how difficult women’s lives were, but in basically how strongly they turned very difficult circumstances to their advantage."&nbsp;</p><p id=ezQq2Ezd8fns data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Viewers in tears watching harrowing drama The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies</a></strong></p><p id=eRalNNHlwos4 data-wc=52>Some characters also took inspiration from real life, with Charlotte Wells most notably being based on Kitty Fisher, a famed prostitute who lived in the 1750s and was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Violet Cross was also thought to be based on Ann Duck, a street thief who was hanged for stealing.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/87bb23510421-violet-duck-z.jpg><p id=eOSqLGOpnSle data-wc=9><strong>Violet is inspired by a real-life woman, Ann Duck</strong></p><p id=ecQnD3Z_ymLw data-wc=64>Moira explained: "We sort of based Violet on her. We hope Violet doesn’t get hanged because she’s great, we love her, but she’s a thief. She’s a street whore and a thief. But it’s much like now, this is a multicultural city, people are surviving in all sorts of surprising and interesting ways, people are confounding your expectations, and we hope this show does."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2toYG1%2BeoWUb2tsZ5iWv62706xkrKCfrHqjrdKem2annmLBs8HEZqqtp6KueqWx05qgpatf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./01-0168-20240413-4047-16906-directo-html.html><span>←</span><span>Cmo qued Quertaro vs Mazatln ?
