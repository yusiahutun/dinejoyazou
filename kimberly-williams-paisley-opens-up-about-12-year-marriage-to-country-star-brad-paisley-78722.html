These days, the actress has been happily married since 2003 and is mom to sons <strong>Huck</strong>, 8, and <strong>Jasper</strong>, 6.</p><p><a href=#>RELATED: Watch Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley Joke About Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert’s Divorce at the CMAs!</a></p><p>“We make sure we have time together,” Kimberly admits. “Take breaks when we can and say ‘no’ to a lot. I’ve had to ask myself: What sparks joy? What do I feel I should do but don’t need to do? That’s helped me.”</p><p>Because of their busy schedules, Kimberly says her ideal date night is just sitting on their porch in Nashville, Tenn. “I’ll have a glass of wine, Brad might have a cigar and we’ll talk. We just love being relaxed together at home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/kim-paisley.jpg><p>Kimberly in November 2015.</p><p>Kimberly’s children also bring her a great deal of joy. “I love being a mom, seeing them grow and getting to have really interesting conversations with them.”</p><p>Balancing an acting career and having a family isn’t always easy. “Either I’m going 100 percent in one direction or another. We try to have calm, quiet Sundays where we’re all hanging out in our pajamas, and I guess that’s the balance we need.”</p><p><b>For the full interview with Kimberly, including her struggle with her mother’s primary progressive aphasia diagnosis, pick up the latest issue of <i>Closer Weekly</i>, on newsstands now!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46koKaalae5unnWoqOloZGiwG68wKKqpZ2pYryxsc2sZK6oXZavsMHTZmhrZamarrN5zJqpq6GRnLJuwM5mmqitnqm%2FunnSrZirZZKnrqV5z5qgrKSVrnp4hJZraWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harry-styles-sparks-race-row-one-direction-fans-poses-native-american-headpiece-html.html><span>←</span><span>Harry Styles sparks a race row among One Direction FANS as he poses in Native American headpiece</span></a>
