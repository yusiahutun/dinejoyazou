Ryan Seacrest, the Emmy Award-winning presenter, and producer, is also poised to return to the popular competition series.”</p><p>Season 21 of American Idol will begin on ABC on Sunday, February 19, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><h2>Meet Zachariah Smith, who will compete in American Idol season 21.</h2><p>Zachariah Smith, a musician, husband, and father from Amory, Mississippi who works at Bill’s Hamburgers, is one of the competitors slated to compete in the program.&nbsp;He began singing at the age of six and learned to play the guitar at the age of eight. In an interview with Monroe Journal, he said that his primary interest is as a singer and entertainer.</p><p>He stated:</p><p>“I’m basically concerned about my voice, as well as entertaining and performing. That, I believe, was the pinnacle of what launched my career.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Zachariah-Smith.jpg alt="Zachariah Smith" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>At the age of 15, the singer considered competing in American Idol but realized he lacked the necessary expertise. After a few years of waiting, he auditioned for the forthcoming season in Nashville in front of famous judges.&nbsp;In the interview, he also said that now that he has acclimated to “adult life,” he would want to pursue his aspirations. He went on to say:</p><p>“I did it because I believed I had a decent chance of getting someplace with it and having the musical career I’d always wanted.”</p><p>In terms of the audition, he recalls that when he arrived, there were perhaps 200 to 300 individuals in the holding area, all of whom were singing. This made him reflect on what a fantastic competition American Idol is and the talent it displays.&nbsp;He went on to say that although observing so many people is a fantastic experience, “self-doubt” creeps in. He went on to say:</p><p>“After I stopped listening to the voices within my brain and got on the horse and began running with it, I started having joy in the process. That motivated me to go into the Nashville audition and give it my all.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Zachariah-Smith-2.jpg alt="Zachariah Smith" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Additional information about the program</h2><p>The season 21 premiere of American Idol will feature auditions in New Orleans, Las Vegas, and Nashville, as well as performances by Luke Bryan, Megan Danielle, Tyson Venegas, Haven Madison, Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, Michael Williams, Lucy Love, Iam Tongi, Colin Stough, Jack Nicora, Kya Monee, and Lyric Medeiros.&nbsp;Ryan Seacrest, who has hosted American Idol since the show’s inception on Fox in 2002, will return as host for season 21.
