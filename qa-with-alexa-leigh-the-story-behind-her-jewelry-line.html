Born in California and raised in Colorado, Alexa Leigh Meyer founded her jewelry line in 2010 with the notion of creating sentimental value behind every piece. Alexa’s vision was to cultivate a jewelry line that could be worn everyday and look good at any occasion. The collection started with double pendant necklaces that are worn with one pendant in front and one at the nape of your neck and has expanded to cuffs, rings, bracelets, and anklets, all of which manifest Alexa Leigh’s vision."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

What motivated you to found your eponymous line</strong>?</p><p>I had lost an old necklace, and my father casually suggested I make it. I was naive enough to try, and that set me down a path of creating an entire jewelry line of delicate necklaces and bracelets. I’ve never looked back. While it was first started as a creative outlet, it quickly became my passion.</p><p><strong>What are the differentiating characteristics of your jewelry?</strong></p><p>It can be worn day to night and withstand the wear and tear of your everyday life. It’s the perfect compliment to an outfit whether you’re wearing a sweat set or a nice dress.</p><p><strong>How did your home state of California impact your design aesthetic?</strong>I was born in California and raised in Aspen Colorado but I don’t think either place really impacted my design aesthetic. I created the line while I was living in New York but regardless of where I am living, I’ve always dressed for comfort first. I wanted to create a jewelry line that could be worn day to night and would last through the wear and tear of life, while also being comfortable enough to sleep in. That second skin jewelry line that you forget is on but looks effortlessly cool with everything!</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-71867 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/clichemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-21-at-11.00.51-PM-500x337.png alt width=272 height=183 sizes="(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-71867 class=wp-caption-text>Alexa Leigh “Star Huggie Hoop” and “Gold Ear Cuff.” Photo credits: Alexa Leigh</p><p><strong>What are 3 words you’d use to describe the Alexa Leigh woman?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Chic, timeless, effortless.</p><p><strong>What was the hardest part of founding your own line? The most rewarding part?</strong></p><p>I think the hardest part is to have the perseverance to keep going. Most brands aren’t an overnight success. You have to be willing to to keep your head down and never give up. There are really no days off. It’s so rewarding to have something that’s your own though and you’re able to do things in your own way. It’s an expression of my spirit and incredibly gratifying.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-71868 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/clichemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/alexa-leigh-2-333x500.jpg alt width=270 height=405 sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-71868 class=wp-caption-text>Alexa Leigh “Snake Necklace” and “Huggie Hoops.” Modeled by Livia Caligor. Photographed by Erica Skylar.</p><p><strong>How do you think the jewelry industry has changed over the course of your career?</strong></p><p>Social media has changed our industry just like it has any other. Having access to a platform that you can display your brand and help tell your story is priceless.</p><p><strong>What is your design process like? Where are your products produced?</strong></p><p>I make the majority of the first samples myself. There’s a headspace that I occasionally get into where the ideas just flow. I don’t know where they come from but they can pour out. In some cases I’ll sketch my ideas and other times I’ll get right to trying to make a sample. Some pieces we leave as limited edition to keep the site fresh and ever evolving but others we love too much to let go of and we make them part of the core line. Styles are made overseas, in Miami or New York.&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-71869 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/clichemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-21-at-11.07.58-PM-500x336.png alt width=295 height=198 sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-71869 class=wp-caption-text>Alexa Leigh “Huggie Hoops” and “Gold Ball Necklace.” Photo credits: Alexa Leigh</p><p><strong>What is your favorite piece of jewelry, or which piece do you think best embodies the ethos of the Alexa Leigh vision</strong>?&nbsp;</p><p>Hard to pick a favorite child but I never take off my comfort rings and love the way a&nbsp;<a href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://alexaleigh.com/collections/necklaces/products/mini-snake-necklace&source=gmail&ust=1619109932173000&usg=AFQjCNFKEU-YFPVBFvkQCgEcAMdBwxI_oA">snake necklace </a>catches the light.

If I had that, I’d make sure to use it all the time. For me, the ideas often come right before I fall asleep or when I am in the right zone mentally during the day. I can totally tell the difference between when I am being right or left brained. I make items I would want to wear myself and hope other people feel the same.</p><p><strong>What’s next for you?</strong></p><p>I don’t pretend to know that! I am constantly thrown curveballs and surprises that I would have never predicted. Whatever comes I let come, and whatever goes I let go. I’m just gonna continue to ride the wave!&nbsp;</p><p>Read more&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>fashion articles</a>&nbsp;at Clichemag.com<br>Photo Credits: <a href=#>Erica Skylar Photography</a>, <a href=#>TBD PR</a>, <a href=#>Alexa Leigh</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnJ6wqbHMmp5nm5%2BifKet0qGgqKZfpq5uw8itn2aZnJrFonnLnqCgoF2ptaZ50q2mq7Fdl7Kptc2dZKGdomK3psPEpamyZZyeu6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miranda-lambert-figure-flattering-outfits-exciting-news-fans-thrilled-giveaway.html><span>←</span><span>Miranda Lambert shares exciting contest news with fans</span></a>
