One of them is “The Black Dog,” in which Swift sings about looking at her ex’s location on her phone, and tracking him as he walks “into some bar called the Black Dog.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In classic Swiftian fashion, there are lots of hidden meanings in the song. First, “the black dog” is a phrase often used to mean depression, popularized, some say, by World War II–era U.K. prime minister Winston Churchill. Of course, it also just sounds like the name of a classic British pub. Swift may not have been thinking about any bar in particular when she wrote it, but she’s had an impact on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://theblackdogvauxhall.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="actual South London tavern the Black Dog" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">actual South London tavern the Black Dog</a> in Vauxhall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pub’s marketing manager, Amy Cowley, told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/taylor-swift-pub-the-black-dog-at-max-capacity-says-marketing-manager-exclusive-8638761 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> that the steep rise in business since the song’s release has been “surreal.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We’re quite lucky because we’re a well-established and well-loved local pub already,” she said. “But that’s the key word—we’re a local pub—so to get this worldwide attention has been crazy.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added: “We’ve had people from all over. We’ve had interest from the States, Spain, Germany, and Australia. It’s been far-reaching.…Every single day since the album has been released, we’ve had to turn people away as we’re at max capacity, so that shows the levels that we’re talking about.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cowley did note that Swifties have been the most gracious of guests. “What’s been great, though, is that the fans have been amazing,” she said. “We’ve had them shifting up to share tables with strangers to let people get in the door, which is really cool.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With pop music fans storming the London pub, there’s a lot of interest in who “The Black Dog” is really about: Swift’s ex of six years, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a41573121/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-relationship-timeline/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joe Alwyn" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Joe Alwyn</a>; or the 1975 frontman <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a43875285/taylor-swift-matty-healy-relationship-timeline/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Matty Healy" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Matty Healy</a>, whom Swift had a short relationship with following her split from Alwyn.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Many of the song’s lyrics suggest a more serious relationship, indicating that it’s about the longer relationship: “I move through the world with the heartbroken / My longings stay unspoken / And I may never open up thе way I did for you.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also, Swift appears to be nodding to her 2019 album Lover, which centered on her relationship with Alwyn, with these lines from the bridge of “The Black Dog”: “Six weeks of breathin’ clean air / I still miss the smoke.” On the Lover track “Daylight,” she sings, “Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Plus, the owner of the Black Dog, Lily Bottomley, hinted that Alwyn is a “regular” at the pub in an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14HWFIHv7OY" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sky News" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sky News</a> on Monday. “I don’t want to give too much away,” she said. “We do have a certain blond regular who frequents, let’s just say that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While that seems like pretty clear evidence, there are also a few allusions to Healy in the song’s lyrics. For instance, in the chorus, Swift mentions American pop-punk band the Starting Line, whom Healy’s group the 1975 covered during shows in New Zealand and the Philippines. There’s also a reference to a woman “too young” to know the song Swift’s ex loves, which could be about Healy’s current girlfriend, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a60539693/who-is-matty-healy-girlfriend-gabbriette-bechtel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gabbriette Bechtel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gabbriette Bechtel</a> (who is nearly a decade Healy’s junior).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Perhaps Swift drew on experiences from both relationships when writing “The Black Dog”; we’ll probably never know for sure. What we do know is that the Black Dog in London will probably have Swifties busting down its door for weeks to come.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/04e4fe03-f532-4e6a-8cd4-455131aa4449_1702400410.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Joel Calfee" title="Headshot of Joel Calfee" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Joel is the editorial and social media assistant for HarpersBAZAAR.com, where he covers all things celebrity news.
