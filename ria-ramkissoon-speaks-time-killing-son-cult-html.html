Though they were stingy with details about the arrangement, she was desperate, and their offer began to sound attractive.</span></p><p><span>'I had a really strong fear that [Javon] was going to get taken away from me if I didn't know what I was doing,' she said. 'That's kind of when I took things in my own hands.'</span></p><p><span>In April 2006, Ramkissoon asked her mother to drive her and Javon to a park.

They packed the body into a suitcase.</span></p><p><span>Miss Ramkissoon sprayed it with disinfectant and stuffed the suitcase with fabric softener sheets to mask the odour.</span></p><p><span>Miss Ramkissoon said she now realises that Javon died because of her own decisions, not because of God's will.</span></p><p><span>'It is difficult,' she said, 'because I don't think it's settled, fully, the weight of what was lost.'</span></p><p><span>Ramkissoon said she's often asked how she can still believe in God. But she credits her faith, and the fellowship she's found at the treatment centre, for allowing her to take control of her life.</span></p><p><span>'Coming from a cult, people don't want to hear you talk about God,' she said.</span></p><p><span>'I may have... approached it the wrong way.
