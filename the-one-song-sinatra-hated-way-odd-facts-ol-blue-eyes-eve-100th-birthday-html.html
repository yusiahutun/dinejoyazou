When he finally emerged, there were no signs of life. So the doctor put him to one side to attend to his mother, Dolly.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It was only when the child’s grandmother picked up the baby, ran cold water over him and slapped his back that he started breathing.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>HE WAS CALLED FRANK AFTER A MIX-UP</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He was supposed to be called Martin after his father, but the priest who conducted his baptism accidentally named him after Frank Garrick, the family friend who was there as the baby’s godfather.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Sinatra’s mother chose to stick with the name, believing the mistake must be a good omen.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>HIS TEEN NICKNAME WAS SCARFACE</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The forceps used during his birth had left scars on the side of his face, and adolescent acne added further marks. Throughout his life, Sinatra wore make-up to hide the scars — and even then hated being photographed on his left side. (The forceps also punctured his eardrum — during World War II this was the reason he was ruled unfit for military service.)</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=2>2</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/06/14/2F1B4B0700000578-0-image-m-26_1449412694345.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Softer side of Sinatra: Heart-melting photos of the day...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/05/16/2F1448A400000578-0-image-a-22_1449334440462.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Our Kind Of Town: Exploring Frank Sinatra's Palm Springs...</span></a></li><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/08/11/2F2A86BE00000578-0-image-a-17_1449574606859.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Would you like some Taylor Swift with your spring rolls?...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>THE FIRST GIRL FANS WERE PAID TO SCREAM</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The young singer certainly had appeal — but George Evans, his publicist, wasn’t taking any chances.

DIED AS HE FILMED A FUNERAL&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The movie Robin And The 7 Hoods was a re-telling of the Robin Hood myth featuring Chicago gangsters. While shooting a scene at a funeral in 1963, the cast and crew received news that John F. Kennedy had been shot and killed. Sinatra, who had been friends with the President, was traumatised.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>HE WAS ALWAYS READY FOR A KIDNAP</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>As if the JFK coincidence wasn’t spooky enough, Sinatra learned during the filming of a kidnap scene in Robin And The 7 Hoods that his own son, Frank Jnr, had been kidnapped. (The scene was cut from the final version of the movie.)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Following the abduction on December 8, 1963, Sinatra received a ransom demand of $240,000, together with the instruction that he must only call the kidnappers from pay phones. In the middle of one call, he ran out of money, and panicked that the error had cost his son’s life. But after payment of the ransom, Frank Jr was released. His father vowed he would never be caught without coins again and always carried a roll of 10 cent coins.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>THE RAT PACK DIDN'T USE THAT NAME&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Sinatra’s famous gang of friends — which included singers Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr, comic Joey Bishop and actor Peter Lawford — were given their famous nickname by Hollywood star Lauren Bacall. But they always preferred to call themselves ‘The Summit’, after a 1960 meeting of world leaders in Paris.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>HIS HOTEL SPANNED TWO U.S. STATES&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>At one time, Sinatra was part-owner of the Cal Neva Lodge resort and casino in Lake Tahoe. The resort was so-called because half of it was in California and half in neighbouring Nevada.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>SINATRA HATED THE GODFATHER&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In the classic Mafia novel The Godfather, later made into an Oscar-winning series of films, the entertainer Johnny Fontane receives help with his career from organised crime figures.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Although the book’s author, Mario Puzo, denied that the character was inspired by Sinatra, the singer — always surrounded by rumours of Mafia links — took it as an insult.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>When the two met in Los Angeles restaurant Chasen’s in 1970, Sinatra screamed: ‘I ought to break your legs!’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>HE WAS A FUSSPOT ABOUT RED CARPETS&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>HIS contracts always specified that the red carpet leading from his dressing room to the stage must be anchored by tacks no more than 18in apart.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Broadcaster Clive James introduced Sinatra at a 1988 concert to mark the opening of the Sanctuary Cove resort in Queensland, Australia. He witnessed the singer’s lawyer bending down with a tape measure to ensure that the clause had been complied with.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>HIS TIPPLE WAS JACK DANIEL'S&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘This is a gentleman’s drink,’ he said of the his favourite drink, Jack Daniel’s. He always had two fingers of whiskey, four ice cubes and a splash of water.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>For some reason, Sinatra would never touch the rim of the glass — he cupped it in his hand, protected by a cocktail napkin.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>HE NEVER LEARNED TO READ MUSIC&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Though he began performing professionally as a teenager in the late Thirties — as a singing waiter at the Rustic Cabin club in Englewood, New Jersey — he never learned formally to read music, instead relying on a good ear to help him hold a tune.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>HIS LAST WORDS WERE ‘I'M LOSING’</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Ol’ Blue Eyes suffered a heart attack on May 14, 1998. His journey to hospital was through empty streets because most people were at home watching the final episode of the TV comedy Seinfeld.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Sinatra’s life couldn’t be saved. His last words were: ‘I’m losing.’ The Empire State Building was lit up in blue in tribute.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>BURIED WITH BOOZE AND CIGARETTES</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>His friends placed a bottle of Jack Daniel’s in his pocket when he was buried and put a pack of Camel cigarettes and a Zippo cigarette lighter in his coffin. His gravestone reads: ‘The best is yet to come.’&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmpsbWNrhXZ7s6GcZqeemnq0u82gZIyhnpbBs62MoZitnZRipKLFjKibnWWWlrC1v4yIo2Z6nKqybpHYnqpmnaaaenJ8j62fZpqZp8GpsMCyZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./temptation-of-mother-in-law.html><span>←</span><span>Home Default - Telly Gupshup</span></a>
