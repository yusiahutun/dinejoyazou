Her childhood is hardly known, and although she has achieved much for herself in the meantime, she is usually referred to as the ex-wife of <a href=#>George Lopez</a>.</p><p>Anne Serrano is an actress and television producer as well as an activist dedicated to charity and awareness-raising. Together with her then-husband, she organized a kidney screening in 2009, which focused on uninsured individuals. This was done not only because of the history of their illness but also to give something back to society during the economic problems of the time.</p><p>She revealed that she was working on starting her talk show as early as 2013, but it has not yet been realized. As an actress, the woman appeared in a few films in which she played smaller roles. These films include Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000) and Arrested Development (2003). In 2002 she also appeared in the television series George Lopez. In 2003 she was again seen in Life with Bonnie.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Samantha Bee Husband and Facts About The American-Canadian Comedian</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Married, Kids, Family, and Divorce</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_16146 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-4339f231af5200fee750d0bf47511cd0" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16146></figure><p>In 1993 Ann Serrano married George Lopez. They married after a meeting in May 1990 at The Ice House. The two stayed together until 2011 when they decided that they would have to separate due to irreconcilable differences. So they decided to divorce.</p><p>Before the marriage ended, Ann and George, who was abandoned by his parents when he was a child and raised by his grandmother who was a vicious woman, had only one daughter between them, born in 1995 and named Mayan Lopez. Just like her parents, Mayan is also an actress. She appeared in Mr. Troop Man’s (2009), Handsome: A Netflix Mystery Movie (2017), and her latest work is Kill Her! Mata La! (2018).</p><p>Shortly before the 17-year-old marriage broke up, the comedian’s kidneys failed due to a genetic disease that almost always kept him ill from 1998 to 2005. It was his wife, Ann Serrano, who donated one of her kidneys to him, and according to him, for many years after waking up he had never felt as good as he does now.</p><p>Although they were completely divorced in June 2011, the battle over the division of their net worth lasted until 2012, when the court ruled that Ann should receive up to half of her husband’s pension benefits and other entitlements. Today, as George Lopez pointed out, he and Ann are in a very good position. Perhaps an important factor is precisely the fact that they have a child together.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Ana Kasparian Husband, Net Worth, Salary, Marital Status, Age, Height</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts About&nbsp;Ann Serrano</strong></h2><p>1.
