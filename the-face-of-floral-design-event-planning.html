Linda Oliver
Linda Oliver was meant to be the owner of Harbour Bay Florist and Events. The nurseturned- stay-at-home-mom volunteered for several nonprofits and served on many a board of directors while raising a family. Ultimately, she was drawn to the special events side of philanthropy. “It was at this time that I fell in love with what I call the magic moment, that moment when satisfied clients see their event room for the first time and see all their hard work and planning come to fruition,” she says."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The nurseturned- stay-at-home-mom volunteered for several nonprofits and served on many a board of directors while raising a family. Ultimately, she was drawn to the special events side of philanthropy. “It was at this time that I fell in love with what I call the magic moment, that moment when satisfied clients see their event room for the first time and see all their hard work and planning come to fruition,” she says. It was this passion that prompted her to open an event planning business called The Main Event in 2000. In 2013, she received a call from a friend who was a floral designer at Harbour Bay, telling her the owner was retiring and asking her whether she would consider buying the business. “I unhesitatingly said yes,” she says. “With my experience in event and wedding planning, Harbour Bay is now no longer just a florist. It is now the only full-service floral and event-management company on the Treasure Coast.” The pink building on Southeast Ocean Boulevard has a special place in her heart, as well, because it is on the route of the Stuart Christmas Parade. “My three children were in that parade collectively for more than 15 years, and we always met under the wonderful tree in the parking lot.”</p><p><strong>772.221.1009 • <a href=#>HarbourBayFlorist.com</a></strong></p><p>Sponsored content</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZLOir8SsZKieXaKus8DIp2SsrF2hwqS1xGiroZ1dm66ksYyonWaenKS%2ForiMnZysoZejeqbCxKerZqiclruvtc2gZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apprentice-star-amina-khan-couldnt-32029309.html><span>←</span><span>The Apprentice star Amina Khan 'couldn't afford Nando's' until clever idea made her 2m</span></a>
