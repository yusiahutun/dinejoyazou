This time, we turn the spotlight on Almada Label, known best for its elevated knitwear.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">Whether it’s Mob Wives or Grandpacore, there is a new style-related TikTok trend pretty much every week and frankly, we should probably not pay much attention to them. However, there is one Internet-derived fashion aesthetic that has actual staying power, and that is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/g44559652/quiet-luxury-brands/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Quiet Luxury" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Quiet Luxury</a>. The movement – which we wouldn’t actually consider a trend at all – is about dressing in elevated classics that you invest in for life. Of course, The Row and Loro Piana are always mentioned when this topic arises, but there are plenty of great brands known for these luxury basics that sit at a slightly more reasonable price point too. One of these is Almada Label, which hails from Finland and is all about high-quality minimalism.</p><img alt="almada label" title="almada label" width=4640 height=6327 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/almada-label-1-65a919ba167d9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Almada Label</span></p><img alt="almada label" title="almada label" width=3968 height=5952 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/almada-label-10-65a919b835293.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Almada Label</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We established the brand in 2020 to address a longstanding quest in our fashion journey – finding timeless luxury knitwear that married quality craftsmanship with accessible pricing,” Alexa Dagmar – who set up the brand alongside Linda Juhola – tells me of the label. The collections are made up of soft cashmere cardigans and jumpers, knit tops and beautiful coats in a muted colour palette, with prices ranging from around £200 to £700. “Our aim is simple: to provide our customers with high-quality, luxury pieces at a reasonable price point. We keep our profit margins lower than the industry standard, ensuring that our customers can access exceptional, reasonably priced fashion. As a result, we've made the deliberate choice not to have sales or discounts, consistently maintaining our commitment to offering the best value.”</p><img alt="almada label" title="almada label" width=1786 height=2436 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/almada-label-3-65a919b980000.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Almada Label</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dagmar and Juhola both had backgrounds in the digital marketing industry, working with various brands, as well as building up followings of their own as bloggers. Seeing a gap in the market for what they call “everyday luxury at a reasonable price”, they set up the business out of their homes during the pandemic, while both of them were pregnant. “The journey was far more challenging than we anticipated,” Juhola says, explaining that the complexities of production and the ever-evolving landscape of logistics and technology, was difficult to manage, but once everything was in place, they were able to focus on what they really believe in, which is high-quality investment pieces, and total comfort.</p><img alt="almada label" title="almada label" width=1680 height=2520 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/almada-label-8-65a919b805410.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Almada Label</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Everyday luxury, to us as two working moms, is synonymous with the simple pleasure of a good night's sleep, which is often a rare treat in our busy lives,” Juhola says. “We also believe that wearing the softest clothes plays a pivotal role in our comfort and overall sense of wellbeing. Being comfortable really radiates an air of elegance.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Comfort, ease and minimalism are all associated with Quiet Luxury of course, but are also indicative of Scandinavian style, which has been a huge influence on Almada’s designs.</p><img alt="almada label" title="almada label" width=1680 height=2520 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/almada-label-7-65a919b82b086.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Almada Label</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It definitely weaves its way into our pieces,” Dagmar says of Scandi style. “Our knitwear embraces clean lines, muted tones, and a commitment to quality craftsmanship, all while maintaining respect for the environment. These are all definitely a reflection of the serene and minimalist Scandinavian aesthetic.”</p><img alt="almada label" title="almada label" width=1443 height=2165 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/almada-label-4-65a919b980800.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Almada Label</span></p><img alt="almada label" title="almada label" width=1443 height=2165 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/almada-label-6-65a919b80feed.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Almada Label</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With plenty of exciting projects in the pipeline (including more size inclusivity, physical retail and new product lines), Dagmar and Juhola feel committed to their vision which, although it might be ‘on trend’ right now, has far more longevity in it than most TikTok moments.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Quiet Luxury is so much more than just a trend; it possesses lasting appeal. If we examine style icons from previous decades, we can see that elements of Quiet Luxury have always been present, social media has merely given it a name. The minimalist designs and neutral colour palettes provide an elegant canvas for personal expression, making it accessible and adaptable.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Discover more about <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://almadalabel.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Almada Label, and shop the latest collection, here." class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Almada Label, and shop the latest collection, here.</a></p><img alt="almada label" title="almada label" width=7722 height=5792 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/almada-label-5-65a919b8661e0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Almada Label</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Helen Mirren: Inside my beauty bag" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/helen-mirren-video-657c80ec3f4a2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSudYKTbG1xbmlkrq25wJ2YZqSRl7Ktew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-tina-leungs-most-iconic-outfits-nyc-and-hong-kong-bling-empire-new-york-slaysians-chanel-boots.html><span>←</span><span>10 of Tina Leungs most iconic outfits in NYC and Hong Kong: from the Bling Empire: New York Slays</span></a>
