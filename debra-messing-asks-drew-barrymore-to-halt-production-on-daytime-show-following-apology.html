You can choose to pay your employees like other talk show hosts who have stood in solidarity with the writers," Messing wrote.</p><p>The Will & Grace alum continued, "There are thousands of union members jobs and livelihoods that are at stake (exponential more than those who work on your show) and the future of our beloved industry."</p><p>"I hope you will reconsider," Messing added.</p><p>Messing isn't the only one to bash Barrymore for her decision. The WGA East came out to slam the longtime actress, reminding audiences that they are picketing shows that continue during the strike.</p><p>"The @DrewBarrymoreTV Show is a WGA covered, struck show that is planning to return without its writers. The Guild has, and will continue to, picket struck shows that are in production during the strike.

"We have navigated difficult times since we first came on air. And so I take a step forward to start season 4 once again with an astute humility."</p><a id=gallery-link-dc31289f-00f7-4a9d-81bf-9ba5baeb89d4 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:dc31289f-00f7-4a9d-81bf-9ba5baeb89d4 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:69bd5fbc-b839-4870-b62b-0ab2826f44ff data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/84/4by3/2023/07/18/843a12ed525f4302b41c945d96189902_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jmam1fmbKjvsBmpJ6ro567qHnArKKsZZSnsrh5wZqpq7GdpL%2BmedOoZKGZnKl6sb7OnaycrJmku267zWabmrGknrqmedKhprBllqS5rbvWoqWgZZGlvK27xrJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shayne-audra-murphy-bio-siblings-parents-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shayne Audra Murphy Bio, Boyfriend, Siblings</span></a>
