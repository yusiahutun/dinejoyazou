Her response went like this, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It's true, I am not a...&nbsp;or whatever people keep saying.

Responding to the interviewer's question regarding her apparel in her music video for Try Me, where she transitions from wearing only intimates to putting on baggy clothes, she said,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Sexy is what you make it.

I can only be me. Not hiding."</p><p>At the same time, her rumor of dating rapper and alleged boyfriend Lil Durk, with whom she collaborated on a few songs, also grabbed massive buzz from the media. But, debunking her boyfriend rumors, she spilled the tea in an interview with<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> HOT 97</a>, saying none of those ever happened. In her words, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>I'm single.
