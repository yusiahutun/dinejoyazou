Her response went like this, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It's true, I am not a...&nbsp;or whatever people keep saying.

I can only be me. Not hiding."</p><p>At the same time, her rumor of dating rapper and alleged boyfriend Lil Durk, with whom she collaborated on a few songs, also grabbed massive buzz from the media. But, debunking her boyfriend rumors, she spilled the tea in an interview with<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> HOT 97</a>, saying none of those ever happened. In her words, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>I'm single.
