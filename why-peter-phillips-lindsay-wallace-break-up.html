The son of Princess Anne and his wife began dating in 2021 and had been laying low since Christmas 2023 when they did not walk with the rest of the family to the traditional church service.</p><p>Born on November 15, 1977, Phillips is the eldest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. While Phillips holds a place in the royal family, he does not carry out official royal duties. He has pursued a career in business, working in various roles including sports management and sponsorship consultancy. Phillips gained attention for his role in organizing events such as the Queen’s 90th birthday celebrations and the Patron’s Lunch in 2016, both of which marked significant milestones for the Queen.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kate-middleton-inheritance.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg><p>Before dating Wallace, Phillips was married to Autumn Kelly for 13 years and they share daughters Savannah, 13, and Isla, 12. Wallace, meanwhile, shares two kids with ex-husband Andrew, to whom she was married for 11 years. Here’s <a href=#>why Peter Phillips and Lindsay Wallace broke up</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=why-did-peter-phillips-and-lindsay-wallace-break-up>Why did Peter Phillips and Lindsay Wallace break up?</h2><p>We’re not exactly sure <a href=#>why Peter Phillips and Lindsay Wallace broke up</a>, but according to multiple outlets, it was an amicable split. People confirmed the news on April 10, 2024, and Phillips’ spokesperson said the news was “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>a private matter</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lindsay-wallace-peter-phillips.jpg><p>Phillips’ mother, Princess Anne, married her&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>first husband</a>&nbsp;Mark Phillips in 1973 and she was the first of Queen Elizabeth’s children to have kids of her own. She raised her children in a quite normal household and talked about not using titles for them in an interview with Vanity Fair. “I think it was probably easier for them, and I think most people would argue that there are downsides to having titles,” she told the outlet. “So I think that was probably the right thing to do.”</p><p>Royal expert Richard Kay told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;that Princess Anne’s children might’ve been Queen Elizabeth’s favorites among the grandchildren.”She has always been close to Peter and admires the way he and his sister Zara [Tindall] handled themselves as grandchildren of the monarch but without royal titles,” Kay said. “Like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>William and Harry</a>&nbsp;and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, Peter and Zara were children of broken homes, but were somehow more exposed because of Anne’s decision that they should not have titles.”</p><p>In a rare interview, Phillips talked about his childhood with his sister and messing with his cousins Prince Harry and Prince William. “We had great fun growing up on our holidays, going to stay with her at Sandringham, Balmoral and Windsor and we were incredibly lucky to be able to share a lot of our childhood time with her,” he shared. ‘We had a lot of fun and there was a lot of space for kids to run around in and it wasn’t just us, it was the Wales’ [William and Harry] Freddie and Ella Windsor and the Gloucesters,’</p><p>Peter was rumored to be Queen Elizabeth’s favorite grandchild before her death in 2022. “She thinks Peter especially has inherited the resilience that is so characteristic of Anne,” royal expert Richard Kay said.&nbsp;“She sees him as dependable.” He also added that Prince Philip might have had the same sentiments</p><p>On her legacy, he noted, “She’s such an inspiration, not only to the country but to us as a family.” He continued: You know, her work ethic and her dedication is something that I think the whole family has always inspired to, at least get somewhere near.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm5namljZMSpxYypnK2domK9qbXLpaCpq12htq%2Bw0pqwZq%2BRobmir8RmmaudkaB6tryO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samantha-hoopes.html><span>←</span><span>Samantha Hoopes Boyfriend?
