It beat numerous automakers with over 100 years of experience at their own game. However, even if electric cars are the future, they're not immune to damage and wear and tear.Although electric vehicles don't need annual oil changes or radiator coolant refills, their battery pack still degrades over time. When that happens, whether through an accident or regular wear-and-tear, you'll want to replace it so you can keep using your car.But how much does it cost to replace a Tesla battery? And can you do it yourself?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=expected-tesla-battery-life>Expected Tesla Battery Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/a-Tesla-supercharger-port-lit-by-a-cars-brake-lights.jpg><p>If you're researching Tesla battery replacement costs to prepare for when your current one wears out, you have little to worry about. Tesla claims the Model S and Model X retain 90% capacity even after 200,000 miles. Third-party research data from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NimbleFins</a> supports this claim, with 150,000-mile cars at 90% and 200,000-mile examples still maintaining over 80% capacity.</p><p>The average American drives around 14,000 miles annually, so the average Tesla would take about 14 years to hit the 200,000-mile mark. Since most Americans keep their cars for 12 years, there's a low chance you need to replace your Tesla battery before you buy a newer model. Furthermore, even Tesla founder Elon Musk himself has said that the Model 3 should last between 300 and 400 thousand miles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another <a href=#>important thing to know about your EV battery</a> is the warranty. Thankfully, Tesla offers an excellent battery and drive unit warranty. All Teslas come with an eight-year or 100,000 (for base Model 3) to 150,000 miles (for Model S and Model X) coverage, whichever comes first. In addition, the guarantee states that batteries will have a minimum of 70% capacity retention within this period.</p><p>Nevertheless, suppose you accidentally damage your car's battery. Or it dies unexpectedly due to a factory defect already beyond the warranty period. In that case, you'll have to spend to get a new one.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-a-tesla-battery-cost-what-musk-said>How Much Does a Tesla Battery Cost? What Musk Said...</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, Elon Musk said replacing battery modules costs between $5,000 and $7,000. However, different Tesla models use a different number of modules per pack. For example, older Tesla models, like the Roadster and Model S P85, have 11 and 16 modules, respectively. While newer versions, including the Model 3 and Model S Plaid, only use four to five modules.</p><p>Considering this, expect Tesla battery replacements to start between $20,000 and $35,000. However, these prices could increase as they do not include incidental expenses (like other parts) and labor. With the most affordable Tesla coming in at $42,990 before rebates, the battery accounts for nearly half to 80% of the cost of the vehicle.</p><p>However, actual battery repair prices vary from what the CEO said.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-a-tesla-battery-cost-at-a-tesla-service-center>How Much Does a Tesla Battery Cost at a Tesla Service Center?</h2><p>According to an invoice from Tesla shared by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Current Automotive</a>, a complete 75kWh battery replacement for a Model 3 costs $16,550.67. That's $2,299.27 in labor and $14,251.40 in parts, with the actual battery costing $13,500.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, battery prices may vary depending on your vehicle model. As Rich Rebuilds shared, remanufactured packs cost between $9,000 and $10,000, while new batteries can cost up to $22,500.</p><p>If you replace your damaged battery pack with a remanufactured one, the average cost would probably be around $13,000 to $17,000, depending on the complexity of the work. However, if you opt for an entirely new battery, you should be ready to shell out upwards of $25,000.</p><h2 id=how-tesla-replaces-your-car-s-batteries>How Tesla Replaces Your Car's Batteries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/a-recharging-Tesla.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are numerous reasons why a Tesla battery pack will die. It could be a voltage regulator issue, a fuse issue, or other minor reasons. However, the entire battery pack is affected even if the problem is just within one battery module.</p><p>That's because the voltages across all battery modules must be similar. Even if just one cell in an entire module displays a value far different from all the others, it could cause that module, or sometimes even the complete pack, to fail.</p><p>When that happens, you bring your car to Tesla, and the company will fix it. However, the automaker won't replace just one module. Instead, it installs a completely new or remanufactured battery pack and then sends the old one to its battery plants for repair and refurbishment. Once the old battery pack is fixed and checked, it is returned into the system, ready to be installed in another car needing a battery swap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Individual battery modules aren't replaced in Tesla shops because the company wants to ensure that the battery it installs in your car has 100% health. For this reason, it has its professionals go over the pack in one of its plants instead of replacing just one part of the battery, putting it back in your car, and then calling it a day.</p><p>While this is an excellent process to ensure that your car returns to a near-new condition when they service it, it's also expensive and might be out of reach for some owners. This is where third-party repair shops come in.</p><h2 id=third-party-tesla-repair-shops>Third-Party Tesla Repair Shops</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If putting down $15,000 on a new battery for your Tesla doesn't make sense right now, you can visit third-party repair shops. These shops will check your vehicle thoroughly to find the exact problem and execute the required repair.</p><p>While you might not get a whole new battery, they will fix the issue and get you back on the road. But most of all, the repair cost at these shops will generally be much more affordable than what Tesla charges.</p><p>However, since Tesla doesn't regulate these shops, you should be careful when picking one to service your electric car. You should check reviews from previously satisfied clients or get a referral from a friend who had their vehicle serviced there before committing.</p><h2 id=can-you-replace-a-tesla-battery-at-home>Can You Replace a Tesla Battery at Home?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/man-repairing-an-old-Volkswagen-Beetle.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you search online, you can find Tesla battery packs and modules for sale. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stealth EV</a> sells a Tesla 5.3 kWh Battery Module (85 kWh Pack) for the Tesla Model S and X at $1,500 a piece. You can even get a replacement <a href=#>Battery Management System</a> from any Tesla store if you need a new one for your car, too.</p><p>Although you can quickly get replacement parts online for your Tesla, you shouldn't dive into this project willy-nilly. You must have knowledge and know-how before diving into the insides of your electric car. After all, these vehicles typically work with dangerously high voltages. If you make a mistake, you could end up getting electrocuted.</p><p>You should also be mindful regarding where the batteries are from. Ensure that the parts you're installing are made by a reputable manufacturer, as damaged or poorly manufactured <a href=#>batteries have started countless e-bike fires</a>. Furthermore, technical details, plans, and schematics are hard to come by. So, unless you're knowledgeable in servicing electric cars or willing to risk damaging your Tesla, you shouldn't do it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're unsure about these things, it's best to stick with the professionals. You can go to official Tesla service centers if you're ready and willing to cough up their costs. Or you could visit a reputable third-party repair shop that will service your Tesla at a fraction of the price—they can also help answer any <a href=#>common questions about EV ownership</a> you may have.</p><p>Nevertheless, if you're interested in working on your Tesla, there are several groups you can join and YouTube channels you can follow to discover how to go about it. But know that if you're working with these things, you must be careful as these batteries are dangerous high-voltage devices. In short, significant health risks are associated with changing a Tesla battery at home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=be-ready-to-lay-out-some-cash>Be Ready to Lay Out Some Cash</h2><p>Whether you plan to replace your Tesla battery at the Tesla Shop, a third-party repair shop, or at home, you should be ready to spend some money. Tesla's own repairs are still the best option, since they replace your battery with a factory-remanufactured or brand-new pack. This ensures that the battery that will be installed has 100% health and is free from any issues in the years to come.</p><p>But if you can't afford the $15,000 or more asking price, your next best option is to go to a reputable third-party Tesla repair shop. You will definitely save money with these service centers if you pick the right one. Or you could do it yourself, provided you know what you're doing or are willing to learn.</p><p>Despite the cost of replacing an out-of-warranty battery, you still save money compared to the gasoline and maintenance expenses of an internal combustion engine car. Plus, you help reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. For most people, that's a win-win situation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIycpqysXaeysbjAnJxmrJWouaJ5wZqrrZ2irnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./winter-olympics-what-curling-how-chess-ice.html><span>←</span><span>Winter Olympics: what is curling?
