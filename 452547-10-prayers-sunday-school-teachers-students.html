The students are supposed to learn how to pray on their own based on the prayers taught at Sunday school. The best place to start is a short prayer for students and teachers. Below are the best Sunday school prayers:</p>Almighty Father, we praise you for those you have called to minister to children in Sunday school. We seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit as we teach the young people to have a thorough knowledge of your word and prepare for salvation. Give us the ability to guide them along the Christian pathway with doctrinally sound teaching. May all Sunday school classes be venues for uplifting the Lord Jesus. In Jesus’ name, Amen!<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Join</a> TUKO.co.ke Telegram channel!

Through Jesus, we pray and believe, Amen. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54befd88cac5756b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 short morning prayers for friends to bless their day</span></p></a><h2>Opening prayer for Sunday school teachers</h2><p class=align-left>A short prayer should always open Sunday school for students and teachers. Such prayers teach about being thankful for the gift of life before praying for other things. They include:</p>Dear God, we thank you for the gift of life and the gift of our children. We especially put our Sunday school class before you. Bless everyone to know you and dedicate their lives to your service. Let everything we do from the beginning to the end of our class be filled with your love. Bless our ears to listen and understand the stories about you. Let us grow to follow the example of Jesus. Amen.Dear Lord and Father of all, we thank you for today's gift. Thank you for the different ways you provide for all of us. You have shown us your love and protection since we were born, and for that, we will be forever grateful. Please help us focus our hearts and minds as we begin our Sunday school class today. Let your Holy Spirit inspire us to listen attentively. Guide us by your everlasting light as we learn more about your word. We pray in the name of Jesus, Amen! <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5a182d8dbe7ae80e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15+ powerful good morning prayers for him to wake up to</span></p></a><h3>Closing prayer for Sunday school teachers and students</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/752362cb8777ff1d.jpg><p class=align-left>Like Sunday school begins with opening prayers, it must also end with closing prayers. These can be prayers like:</p>Heavenly Father, as we end our Sunday school session today and head back to our families, we thank you. We pray that all we learnt will help us to become better people. Help us remember these important lessons each day and show <a href=#>love and affection </a>to others. When we are alone, remind us that Jesus will always be our friend and that we will never be on our own. We thank you in Jesus’ name, Amen. Dear Father in heaven, in Proverbs 22:6, you said, "Teach children how they should live, and they will remember it all their lives." We, therefore, pray that you will bless our Sunday school class to remember what we have taught them today.

Instead, they have to be prayerful, just like they teach their students. Below are examples of prayers for Sunday school teacher's meetings:</p>Lord God, we ask you to guide us as we teach young people to be spiritual people. Enlighten us always to follow the example of Jesus. Send your Holy Spirit to guide and protect all children as they pass through our hands.

As a result, these teachers must be prayed for to fulfil their duties in a holly manner with prayers like:</p>Almighty God, you are the one who gave us our beautiful teachers. We thank you for them and ask you to bless the work of their hands. Thank you for giving them the gift to teach us in a way that we understand. Fill their hearts with courage so that Satan may not take over their lives. Let them have the strength to rise to all challenges they face. Make them kind to continue helping others. In Jesus' name, we pray, Amen.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54befd88cac5756b.jpg>Dear Lord, our Sunday school teachers are our role models. They teach us how to pray well and have a personal relationship with you. Bless their families for supporting them in their call. Let their lives be peaceful and free of all the turmoil caused by evil. Most importantly, let all their students grow to be good people like them. We ask all this in the wonderful name of Jesus, Amen. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b0d294b1367a6f3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 types of prayer in Christianity and when to say them</span></p></a><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><li>How do you pray in Sunday School?
