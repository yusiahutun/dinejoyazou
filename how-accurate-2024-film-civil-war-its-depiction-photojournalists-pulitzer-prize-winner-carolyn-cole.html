How realistic are those dangers, and what did you think of their colleagues’ actions in those scenes?</strong></p>The dangers of covering conflicts are real. Photographer and friend Chris Hondros, along with Tim Hetherington, were both killed in Libya during <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the Arab spring</span></a> [a series of anti-government uprisings in the early 2010s]; Associated Press female photojournalist Anja Niedringhaus was killed in a targeted attack in Afghanistan; and I witnessed a colleague grazed in the head by a bullet in Haiti, just to name a few.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The Best Is Yet to Come: journalistic integrity in China under the spotlight</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over 78 journalists were killed in 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bond between reporters and photographers can be very strong.

Do you have a guiding principle in the work that you do?</strong></p>My mission has always been to be the eyes of those who cannot be there to witness what is happening in person. That was certainly my objective while covering the Iraqi people from Baghdad as the US began to drop bombs there in 2003, and in Afghanistan after <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the events of September 11</span></a>.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/886ea879-a376-4756-808b-af5810da4a87_64c00494.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I think of photographs as evidence, documentation of what happened and the effect on those involved.

It used to be that most people at home and abroad understood the role of journalists, but unfortunately, we have now become targets ourselves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Lee and her colleagues regularly enter volatile situations quickly, without really assessing what may be going on or the dangers they may face.

What is the real-life process like for knowing where to go and under what auspices?</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is a process of collecting as much information as possible about any given situation. A road that is safe one day could be too risky the next. That is why journalists are always asking questions. It takes drive and determination to get to the front line.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the end, it is about risk-taking.

I do not believe soldiers would have allowed journalists to be so close to the action, even helping them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Regarding protective gear, some journalists do not wear vests and helmets because they think it gives them a false sense of security, or they cannot move as freely.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I have always worn it in conflict situations, but I have also been lucky not to have been hurt.
