However, it looks like all may not be what it seems.</strong></p><p>When the two words <a href=#>MTV VMAs</a> are mentioned, most minds will cast back to the infamous <a href=#>Taylor Swift and Kanye West incident</a>. Did Timberlake and Meg create another moment that will live on forever like this? Unfortunately, it seems not.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1677577265-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-justin-timberlake-and-megan-thee-stallion-s-heated-exchange-at-the-vmas-goes-viral>Justin Timberlake and Megan Thee Stallion’s ‘heated exchange’ at the VMAs goes viral</h2><p>In a video going viral on X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>, it looks like there could be an argument going on between the two <a href=#>music</a> icons.</p><p>Tensions look high in a crowded backstage area where the Hot Girl Summer singer can be seen topping up her glam, while there’s a boyband reunion going on in the back, as members of NSYNC walk past.</p><p>The Mirrors singer can then be seen smiling as he leans in to say something to Meg, who then shakes her fingers towards him before turning away with, not the most pleased expression on her face.</p><p>Joey Fatone can then also be seen saying something. But what could they have said to cause this reaction from the Bongos star? Well, it seems like sources may have revealed all.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-all-is-not-what-it-seems>All is not what it seems</h2><p>Despite fans wanting some drama between the two <a href=#>artists at the MTV VMAs</a>, unfortunately, in this case, that was not the case. In fact, a source has spoken out directly and clarified what actually happened between the two, and it’s actually quite adorable.</p><p>“He said, ‘It’s so nice to meet you,’ and she said ‘No, no this don’t count, this don’t count. We gotta meet proper,'” a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">source</a> tells Variety. “There was zero fight,” they claimed.</p><p>Another source told the publication a similar thing: “Meg loves Justin. She was saying “No, no, no, we’ve never met before. It was their first time meeting and she was excited.”</p><p>All is well in Meg and NYSNC land. Let’s hope she takes a trip to the reunion tour (which we’re praying actually does happen).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1677148854-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-fangirls-over-nsync-reunion>Taylor Swift ‘fangirls’ over NSYNC ‘reunion’</h2><p>It looks like Meg wasn’t the only one ‘fangirling’ over Timberlake and the rest of the boys. In fact, alongside all her other awards, Taylor Swift can also be given the ‘Biggest Fangirl award’ for her speech directed at the Bye Bye Bye band.</p><p>Before the band presented the Bad Blood singer with the Best Pop Award, for her video Anti-Hero, she can be seen screaming and cheering in the crowd.</p><p>When going up on stage she ‘can’t deal’ with being up on stage with the guys, telling them she had her dolls as a teen. She’s just like us!</p><p>“Are you going to do something? What’s going to happen now? They’re going to do something and I need to know what it is!” she exclaimed. Don’t we all Taylor, don’t we all.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2aAcLnTr2SvpZGoeqvB0q2gp2WknrqjsdGlmKSdXZa7pXnMnp6apl2ptaaxjKyrmqScnryvv4ybmJyjo6muqLGMn6CgoKRixKK%2FjKympp2knbavs4yeo6ydXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apple-butter-syrup.html><span>←</span><span>LMCo.
