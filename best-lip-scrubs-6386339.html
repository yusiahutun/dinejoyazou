InStyle cut out the middleman and tested over 20 different scrubs to find the very best in hydration, formulation, and cost. Out of all the products we tested, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Fresh Sugar Lip Polish Exfoliator</a> has been crowned the winner for its exfoliating abilities without drying out lips.

If it’s more than two steps, she instantly gets disinterested, so you know it’s important if she’s willing to add an extra step for the right product. The one lip scrub I always keep stocked for my picky sister is the Fresh Sugar Lip Polish that InStyle testers also agree is all that. This bad boy is jam-packed with moisturizing ingredients like jojoba oil and vitamin E that keeps the product from getting too grainy recalls one tester.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This lip scrub differs from others on the market for its use of brown sugar crystals instead of regular sucrose for the exfoliating portion. “The texture and feel are great, but the brown sugar is sticky,” one tester tells InStyle. All this means is you might have to wipe excess product off a few times to avoid lips adhering together slightly. Make sure you wash your hands before dipping your fingers into the circular pot to limit bacteria and apply the scrub all over your lips to gently scrub away any flakiness. Prepping your lips for dry weather or a makeup look makes a noticeable difference, and this exfoliator can be used multiple times per week.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.35 oz |<strong> Key Ingredients: </strong>Brown sugar crystals, jojoba oil, shea butter, vitamin E</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-dior-addict-lip-sugar-scrub></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dior Addict Lip Sugar Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dior Addict Lip Sugar Scrub Tested" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7390JilAOBP2VBnvJ3UTRjGxl3s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/DiorAddictLipSugarScrubBadge-ca7c16d5a9e64a4eb128401a49c6a1fd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Exfoliation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beauty TikTok is a weird space on social media with its mixed bag of content and random clips. From non-professionals giving random advice to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>new and cult classic makeup products</a> going viral seemingly overnight. One such beauty favorite is the Dior Addict Lip Sugar Scrub, which has its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>own spotlight</a> (and 90.7 million views) on the app. Right now, I can count three different bags in my apartment that have this buttery exfoliating scrub awaiting me at the bottom for on-the-go use. That’s how obsessed I am. (Also, yes, I’m a Sephora Rouge member if that wasn’t obvious).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">InStyle testers were also really into this balm-like scrub with sugar crystals that melt on lips. “The texture and feel of the product are very soft, though it is definitely grainy from the exfoliating aspect. However, it’s not too hard or unpleasant. It’s not at all sticky or tacky and glides on smoothly and easily.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This balm is a little different from other scrubs because of its two-in-one system. The melted sugar crystals create a velvety texture on the lips, then the beeswax and mango seed butter level up the soft, smooth feeling. “Once you wipe your lips, you cannot feel the hydration almost at all,” one tester says. The same reviewer continues, “Nowhere on the packaging did it say how long to keep it on or take it off, so I believe it’s meant to stay on.” And it is. If you’re looking for a luxe investment, this is the one to keep treating yourself with.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.12 oz |<strong> Key Ingredients: </strong>Synthetic beeswax, vitamin E, mango seed butter</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4054 data-sizes=750px alt="A person applying Dior Addict Lip Sugar Scrub to their top lip" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7uImFBMXxxon01Q0CR8AqlXfvYM=/fit-in/1500x4054/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/DIOR-ADDICT-LIP-SUGAR-SCRUB-JESSICAJULIAO-0325.jpg-c4576a964cf047ceb19c1aaadde33812.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3860 data-sizes=750px alt="An open tube of Dior Addict Lip Sugar Scrub" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PnOYQY-_0jRz_Z1J2TwsvUjW96M=/fit-in/1500x3860/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/INS-dior-addict-lip-sugar-scrub-janelle-jones-452.jpg-6513425194f442ef9adc2ae5a35b61e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Janelle Jones</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-chapstick-total-hydration-conditioning-lip-scrub></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chapstick Total Hydration Conditioning Lip Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chapstick Total Hydration Conditioning Lip Scrub" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Xix77Mk5sex82uCBLAcWJYZ2eio=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ChapstickTotalHydrationConditioningLipScrubBadge-4533345c532e40b5a8c9e33759ce77c3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Exfoliation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">An InStyle Lab tester was so amazed by this conditioning lip scrub that it got them on the lip care bandwagon, “I can now see the appeal of using a lip scrub in the mornings,” they confirm. Chapstick is one of the OG’s in lip care for no-fuss products that leave lips feeling nourished, and their lip scrub is no different. Their formulation relies on natural ingredients like shea butter and maracuja oil to condition lips as the sugar beads scrub away dead skin and flakiness. “The tiny exfoliating beads were more effective than expected. The beads aren’t visible until it touches your lips, where you can slowly start to see and feel it almost dissolve into your lips,” says one tester.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“My lips felt like I had moisturized them without the oiliness or tackiness. I would say the scrub holds true to its name; if not anything else, this scrub will keep your lips feeling hydrated for a while after application.” On its own, the scrub hydrates lips after use, but if you want a more long term effect, you can combine it with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">lip balm</a> or <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">serums</a> from the collection for maximum care.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.27 oz |<strong> Key Ingredients: </strong>Sucrose, shea butter, beeswax, peppermint oil, vitamin E, maracuja oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-burts-bees-conditioning-lip-scrub-with-exfoliating-honey-crystals></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Burt's Bees Conditioning Lip Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Burt's Bees Conditioning Lip Scrub" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yoCOpALAUTesmX35jmyGj6yhOcU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BurtsBeesConditioningLipScrub-11ed4336239848c2afa78af7b1015479.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Exfoliation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Burt’s Bees created an excellent introduction into the world of lip scrubs with this conditioning exfoliator, another natural favorite on this list. You can pick this up at a drugstore price almost anywhere and know it’ll work. “My lips were left feeling super hydrated, and the texture reminded me of a lip oil once the product was warmed from the temperature of my lips,” says an InStyle Lab tester. The scrub-to-oil effect is a product of natural ingredients, such as castor seed oil, vegetable oil, and beeswax, that melt fast on the lips.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some exfoliating formulas might contain sugar crystals that dissolve on the lips as you rub, but that’s where this one differs. One tester saw the mixture begin to stick together with the base ingredient of honey, “The exfoliator became clumpy after about 45 seconds of use and became one glob of sugar on my lip.” Some extra wiping might be necessary, but the honey crystals do leave a glossy and nourishing sensation on the lips.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.25 oz |<strong> Key Ingredients:</strong> Honey, castor seed oil, vegetable oil, beeswax</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-flaky-lips-sara-happ-the-lip-scrub></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Flaky Lips</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sara Happ The Lip Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sara Happ The Lip Scrub Badge" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PYntsVb_TKJcLXpg8ioxm1pMlJY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SaraHappTheLipScrubBadge-9b67fc76ca2040a4adc16741409abf07.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Exfoliation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When the weather takes a turn for the worst — that could be from intense dry heat or frigid cold — your lips probably suffer from all the licking and biting you do subconsciously. I’m not too fond of chapped lips during wintertime, especially when my lips start to crack and bleed from cold air, so a scrub between lip mask sessions is a must. Sara Happ knows one way to avoid this is weekly exfoliating to promote healing and safely remove flaky skin. An InStyle tester says the grainy formula, while “slightly harsher than I would like,” still left her lips very soft and hydrated.

The product image alone shows how packed this container is, with more scrubbing factors than filler to shuck off dry spots without irritation. Because of how tightly packed the product is (you get an entire ounce of lip goodness), the scrub can get messy. “You may find bits of the scrub spreading all around your mouth area.

Before InStyle narrowed down the list, we researched to find the dermatologist-recommended, editor beloved, and already highly rated lip scrubs on the market. Once we found the ones worthy of praise, InStyle put them to the test. Many lip scrubs tested had their own directions, so our testers followed the recommended use for each product. These directions mainly consisted of using the product on clean lips in a circular motion for a few seconds (or minutes) before wiping off the excess product that didn’t melt away. Each tester applied a lip scrub to product-free lips with their fingers and/or an applicator if the designated product had one. Then based on the product’s texture, dead skin removal abilities, and lasting moisture, InStyle examined each scrub on a scale of 1 to 5. After multiple tests, we found the ten best lip scrubs that deserve their own crown.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some lip scrubs are more grainy than others. If you’re dealing with a lot of damage on your lips, consider a lip scrub product that’s more balm than scrub as your lips heal before using a product that may be too abrasive. Dr. Shamban says a good lip scrub will have a combination of a physical (sugar or microbeads) or a chemical (like fruit acids or enzymes) exfoliant with humectants and emollients. Let’s break that down: Humectants like glycerin and hyaluronic acid attract water to penetrate the skin, while emollients — lipids like shea butter and vitamin E — create a protective film to seal in nourishment. Our best overall pick, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Fresh Sugar Lip Polish Exfoliator,</a> has shea butter and brown sugar.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Application</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Proper application is one thing, but the real question of, “Should I use that weird silicone brush thing I see on TikTok?” is something else entirely.&nbsp; Before you pick a lip scrub, think about that little tool some scrubs are starting to include, Dr. Shamban is all for the silicone brush but says a finger will work just fine. The bumpy tool is an excellent addition to the overall experience if you want something to penetrate the product better or to avoid getting your fingers messy.

She notes that scrubs can be troublesome for some depending on how damaged lips are and how excessive you’re scrubbing. According to the dermatologist, skin on the lips is only three to five layers, compared to the 15-16 layers of skin on the face (and that's one reason why <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>face exfoliators</a> are different). Less protection from outside factors can cause lips to peel, chap, and feel dry more frequently if not cared for properly. A lip scrub can help exfoliate the dead skin cells and peel the outer layer of skin from the lips, says Dr. Shamban.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">She shares, “It can leave smooth lips, but it can also cause redness, inflammation, irritation, bleeding, and further cracking for some.” As with any skincare product, if your skin starts to feel inflamed or bleed after use, stop using the product and consider a less grainy scrub, or stick to nourishing salves like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Malin + Goetz Mojito Lip Balm</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is there a proper way to use a lip scrub?

Generally, it’s a good practice to always cleanse your hands before using any skincare or makeup products with your fingers. Dr. Shamban recommends gently applying the product with a silicone applicator or your finger, back and forth on each lip or in circular motions on closed lips. (Remember, no eating of the forbidden treat.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“To get the most benefit from a lip scrub, leave it on and wait a minute before removing,” says Dr. Shamban. She adds that masks are safe to stay on for five minutes or more. When InStyle tested the best lip scrubs, many reviewers left masks on for multiple minutes to get the whole scrub experience. Like our testers, you can remove the scrub with a warm (NOT hot) cloth. After you remove the scrub, apply a moisturizing balm to seal in hydration.
