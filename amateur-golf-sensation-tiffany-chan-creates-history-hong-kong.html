It's very satisfying."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still trailing Hsieh by a shot heading to the par-five 12th, Chan chipped in for eagle to take the outright lead for the first time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2015/08/07/tiffany_swing.jpg>"I knew I had to make at least a birdie there, so to see the ball go in for eagle was a pretty exciting moment," said Chan. "But I knew there were a few holes to go and it wasn't until the 15th, where I holed a 20-footer for birdie, that I thought I could win."<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another birdie came at the 17th, where she found the par-five in two, allowing Chan to take a strong lead into the last hole.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I hit a good drive down the fairway on the 18th and I was pretty confident from that point that I was going to do it," said Chan, who made a last-minute decision to play in Taiwan after failing to make it into this week's US Women's Amateur.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As an amateur, Chan was not entitled to the winner's share of the prize purse, which instead went to Hsieh.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By her own admission, Chan has struggled with her game in recent months. Despite solid results at the Queen Sirikit Cup and the inaugural Hong Kong Ladies Open, both of which took place at the Hong Kong Golf Club earlier this summer, Chan had been unhappy with her ball-striking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/08/07/ab1d7462f44e9263aa1c0869c7385509.jpg>But three consecutive weeks of practice at Fanling, with input from the club's director of golf, Dean Nelson, and Hong Kong Golf Association national coach Brad Schadewitz, has her back to her best.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I'm playing as well as I have in a long time and I'm very thankful for the support I've had from both the Hong Kong Golf Club and the Hong Kong Golf Association," said Chan, who will enrol at the University of Southern California this month after two seasons at Daytona State where she was ranked the number one junior college golfer in the country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"It's great to win an event as big as this before heading back to the States."</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: 'Typhoon' Tiffany in whirlwind win</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1moaeenHqsu82gZpqqpJ6wrbGOam9tb2ZlhXCtzJqrnq2iYrSwuMVmqp6mo5bBqrvNZquinpaWu7p5wqGYp2WTp7KiwMSsZKGho6m8s8WMoaann12gvK%2Bz</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kyle-petty.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kyle Petty dating?
