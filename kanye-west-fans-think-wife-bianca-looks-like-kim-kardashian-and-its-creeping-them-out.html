They quickly tied the knot that October.

They joked she was like a “drawing” of the reality <a href=#>TV</a> star.</p><p>Kanye initially posted the photos on his <a href=#>Instagram</a>. This isn’t common for the star, as <a href=#>Kanye West</a> usually stays clear of social media for months at a time. But he’s clearly had a change of heart <a href=# rel=nofollow>recently</a>.</p><p>One person wrote: “She’s like if someone tried drawing Kim K from memory,” and someone else echoed, “This lit just another Kim K.”</p><p>Another penned: “The fact she looks so much like Kim is kinda weird,” and added a laughing face emoji.</p><p>A third joked: “Mom: ‘We have Kim K at home’ *The Kim K at home*.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Beyonce’s skin-tight corset look is so ‘clueless’ – but it’s not a shady insult</a></p><p>Someone else said: “Ye really just went and found himself a Kim replacement.”</p><p>Others noted she didn’t look very happy in the snaps. However, this is quite similar to Ye himself, who is known for not smiling for the camera.</p><p>One user said: “Why does his wife never smile in photos?”</p><p>Another penned: “She definitely is not enjoying this [skull emoji].”</p><p>A third wrote: “She doesn’t look happy.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bianca-s-friends-are-concerned-about-her>Bianca’s friends are ‘concerned’ about her</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1254695432-1024x804.jpg><p>A source previously <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> US Weekly Kanye West’s wife Bianca feels “isolated” in their relationship and the Australian native’s friends find it “hard to tell” how she’s feeling, but they are “happy if she’s happy.”</p><p>The source claimed: “Bianca’s friends are becoming concerned because their friendship with her hasn’t been the same in quite some time. Bianca has always been a strong, independent woman who has her own voice, but they haven’t seen that lately because they don’t speak or see each other as often as they had before she started seeing Kanye.”</p><p>However, another explained to the publication, the <a href=#>music</a> star feels his wife “understands him like nobody else” and they are said to have a strong connection.</p><p>West “hasn’t found this kind of happiness in a long time,” they said. “Bianca fulfills him in so many ways and understands him like nobody else ever has. He absolutely adores her and really appreciates how much she loves his children. Bianca is exactly what Kanye needed in his life and he can’t wait to spend the rest of his life with her.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Selena Gomez’s confession over ‘quitting music’ will be tragic news for fans</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WAcLfAp7CeZaeawLV5xZqlrGWknbavt4ywoJ%2BdXZe2orrCmmSlp5%2BgwG64yKScZqOZonqsrdGdmKygmZa7bq3NnWSirKNisLOxxKmgp59dqbWmuYyorK1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scooter-brauns-ithaca-holdings-acquires-atlas-music-publishing.html><span>←</span><span>Scooter Brauns Ithaca Holdings Acquires Atlas Music Publishing</span></a>
