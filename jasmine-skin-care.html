Things tend to get drier on the whole, which means that even oily complexions suddenly start to get parched and peely. We’ll pass.</p><p>This season, we’re really into jasmine for fighting off that seasonal skin fatigue. The flower’s extract has been around forever in everything from perfume to pain-killers, and ever since we started putting it on our skin, we’ve noticed a reduction in both blemishes <i>and</i> dryness. Calling it a cure-all might be a bit&nbsp;hyperbolic … but it’s not too far of a stretch.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hair-growth.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/labor-day-sales.jpg><h2><strong>It’s good for all skin types.</strong></h2><p>Gently clarifying, soothing, hydrating—jasmine does it all. “Jasmine essential oil and extracts can help balance moisture in the skin, as well as protect skin with antibacterial properties,” confirms <strong>Terese Linke</strong>, global education and training director for <a href=# rel=nofollow>Amala Beauty</a>. Above all, it’s gentle and balancing, which means it won’t irritate sensitive skin or cause breakouts for the acne-prone, despite its deeply moisturizing properties.</p><h2><strong>It’s hydrating, but it won’t clog your pores.</strong></h2><p>Jasmine is ideal for skin in need of hydration, yes, but it won’t clog pores in the way so many “moisturizing” products will. In fact, the antibacterial properties help to clear up stubborn blemishes (and the equally impossible scars they leave behind) as well as to fend off zits in the first place. Acne-prone skin types tend to be dehydrated rather than dry, and jasmine helps to quench that dehydration without overloading the skin with moisture. Basically, it’s a one-size-fits-all type of deal.</p><h2><strong>It’s perfect for protecting the skin.</strong></h2><p>Antioxidants are major for defending the skin against environmental stressors and free radicals, and jasmine is packed with the good stuff. Those antioxidants, combined with&nbsp;jasmine’s antiseptic, antibacterial, and antiviral components, mean jasmine&nbsp;helps boost the skin’s natural immunity too. This is key when cooler weather arrives, as your skin is at its most vulnerable when suddenly subjected to unexpected—and sometimes dramatic—temperature changes.</p><h2><strong>It has major aromatherapeutic properties.</strong></h2><p>When jasmine skin care is used topically, its aromatherapeutic properties are unparalleled for soothing the mind and body. And winter is definitely the season for needing a little bit of stress relief from time to time. You don’t need to invest in a steam treatment or 100 percent jasmine extract—just take a deep breath of your oil or serum of choice, like the lovely <a href=# rel=nofollow>Amala Jasmine Hydrate Treatment Oil</a> ($116) or <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cover FX A + Jasmine Custom Infusion Drops</a> ($48), as you apply. Go ahead and milk that spendy treatment for all it’s worth.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Rose Oil Is Beauty’s Priciest New Ingredient—But Is it Worth the Money?</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWSBen%2BPbmloopGouqq6xGaqpKGeYrCivsRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-left-hospital-unnoticed-taking-a-leaf-out-of-meghans-book-photographer-says.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton left hospital unnoticed 'taking a leaf out of Meghan's book', photographer says</span></a>
