Fans of the Golden Globe winner may be shocked to find that there are some facts about her they might not know.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Halle, born in 1966, grew up in Ohio. She moved to New York City after college to pursue a career in show business. In 1989, she snagged the role of Emily Franklin in </span><i><span>Living Dolls </span></i><span>for 12 episodes. The show only lasted one season. The Revlon spokesmodel searched for more television and film opportunities in Los Angeles before snagging a role in 1991’s </span><i><span>Jungle Fever</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Throughout the ‘90s, Halle appeared in </span><i><span>Father Hood</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Flinstones</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Bulworth</span></i><span>. It was her role in the 1999 television film </span><i><span>Introducing Dorothy Dandridge</span></i><span> that earned the beauty her first-ever Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Television Movie and a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Motion Picture – Television.</span></p><p><span>In 2001, Halle earned praise for her performance of Leticia Musgrove in </span><i><span>Monster’s Ball</span></i><span>.

It was a role that stuck out to her as one of her favorites, even two decades after the film was released.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I was really excited about </span><i><span>Bond</span></i><span> because that’s a franchise that’s iconic,” she told </span><a href=#><i><span>Vanity Fair </span></i></a><span>in December 2021. “It’s a part of film history, really, so to be a part of that franchise was very meaningful to me. And this version of a Bond woman was very different than any Bond woman I had seen before.”</span></p><p><span>On top of her career as a world-renowned actress and producer, Halle is a full-time mom. She welcomed her daughter, <a href=#>Nahla Aubry</a>, with her ex-boyfriend, </span><b>Gabriel Aubry</b><span>, in 2008.

Because of COVID, we spent four months talking on the phone,” she told </span><i><span>AARP</span></i><span> about her beau in January 2022. “We were forced to only let our brains connect and discover if we had a connection before our bodies decided to get involved. I’d never done it this way. We talked for hours and hours and hours and hours and never got tired. I fell in love with his mind, his conversation. I realized: I really like him. I really liked who he was, and I can’t say I felt that way before.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to learn five facts about Halle that you might not know.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46fmJyso2LGsMGMnaCdpqRiuK%2B71maYm6elqXqprculnGaalae%2FunnAp5tmoJWneqSt0Z6cq2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-surprising-facts-about-maltese-cross.html><span>←</span><span>20 Surprising Facts About Maltese Cross</span></a>
