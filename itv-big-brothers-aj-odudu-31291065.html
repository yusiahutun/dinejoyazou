One person on X said at the time, "Sorry but AJ Odudu is the most stunning person on earth." Another added: "My highlight of every evening is seeing what AJ Odudu is wearing on <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Big Brother</a>."</p><p>Her latest show-stopping outfit comes days after AJ discussed whether she would consider taking over Holly Willoughby’s job on <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>This Morning</a>. The former presenter recently announced she would be stepping down from the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>ITV</a> show after 14 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31245161.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_Big-Brother.jpg><p>However, AJ shut down the idea citing the early starts as the main reason admitting that she "doesn’t do mornings." She is currently on-air late as the host of Big Brother: Late and Live so not wanting to be up at the crack of dawn is understandable.</p><p>AJ previously admitted that she felt the pressure following in the footsteps of Davina McCall, Brian Dowling and Emma Willis with co-host Will Best. She told Daily Star before the series kicked off: "The pressure is on, it's a big show, it's everyone's baby. We all grew up watching it but then there's a whole new audience that we want to bring along on the ride as well. And also it's had previous presenters who both Will and I both love, adore and respect, they're the nation's sweethearts, and we want to do everyone proud.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p><b><i>Have you joined Threads?

He's really good at his job and I'll be in safe hands with him and vice versa, so I'm actually more excited than nervous for sure."</p><p>"I definitely want to be myself and Will wants to be himself, we're not trying to mimic or imitate previous presenters that have been before. But it's really nice when you have a lot of good will and positive energy on your side for sure."</p><p><b>Big Brother airs Sunday to Thursday on ITV2 and ITVX at 9pm followed by Big Brother Late & Live at 10pm</b><b></b></p><p><b><i>Have you joined Threads?
