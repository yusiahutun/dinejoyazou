A daytime flight increases your chances of spending lots of time pacing up and down the aisle and trying to keep little ones entertained, whereas a nighttime flight will hopefully ensure you can all get some sleep, helping the journey to go quicker.</p><p id=eGoA7spvp7yd data-wc=35>On an evening flight you will likely have an hour or two with the lights on while the meal is served, before they are dimmed for the night, giving you all the opportunity to rest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7dfb307c38a4-children-on-plane-z.jpg><p id=ev2B6wHRoB_n style=text-align:center data-wc=10><strong>A nighttime flight can be a good choice for families</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Pack plenty of snacks</h2><p id=e5WRZ1G2bWm4 data-wc=91>Snacks are an essential when travelling with children, especially if you’re worried your little ones won’t eat the in-flight meals. Stash some of their favourite snacks in your hand luggage to avoid any hangry meltdowns throughout the flight. Meanwhile, if you’re travelling with a baby, advice from <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>gov.uk</a> states that you are allowed to carry enough baby food, milk and sterilised water as you need for the journey. There is no legal limit to how much you can take, however, individual containers of breast milk must contain no more than 2,000ml.</p><p id=ekP9akc0VYDe data-wc=12><strong>SEE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>9 family travel mistakes that are costing you money this summer</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Bring entertainment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3895baebf7b2-girl-colouring-on-plane-z.jpg><p id=eNJEP2EM6q6S style=text-align:center data-wc=8><strong>Colouring or sticker books can provide good entertainment</strong></p><p id=eglbP7dy6M4b data-wc=85>While you don’t want to weigh down your hand luggage with toys and books, a few carefully-selected activities can help to keep children entertained on a long-haul flight. Think colouring, activity or sticker books, or <span><strong>games you can all play together</strong></span> during the journey. Avoid packing toys or games with small pieces, as you may find that you spend much of the flight rummaging around on the floor trying to find lost parts under the seats, not fun for anyone.</p><p id=eSvlOr7kc5Nn data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a aria-label="What you need to pack for a holiday: 89 must-have items" class=hm-link href=#>What you need to pack for a holiday: 90 must-have items</a></strong></p><h2>Pack as light as possible</h2><p id=e_UnQbLMq-ex data-wc=65>While you'll want to make sure you're fully stocked up with snacks, entertainment and a spare change of clothes, try and avoid packing too much in your hand luggage. Over packing or having unorganised hand luggage can make your experience travelling through the airport and on the plane more stressful, so try to create a checklist of all the essentials you need, and pack accordingly.</p><h2 dir=ltr>A bit of screen time is okay</h2><p id=eiIyutUMnHUO data-wc=77>If there’s a time when screen time may be called for, it’s when you’re confined to the cabin of a plane for hours on end. Take advantage of the entertainment system on board most planes, which will likely have films or episodes of their favourite shows to keep children entertained for a while. You could also try audiobooks or music as a way to engage little ones without them spending the whole journey staring at a screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1714c67b9fe0-toddler-watching-screen-on-plane-z.jpg><p id=eiBA94tSSPyX style=text-align:center data-wc=7><strong>Take advantage of entertainment on the plane</strong></p><h2>Burn off energy before the flight</h2><p id=emHp8eQshWX data-wc=58>If you're hoping your family will get some rest on the flight, one of the best things you can do is to burn off their energy before you board. Let children run around in an uncrowded area or simply go for a long walk through the airport before boarding to increase the chances of everyone getting some rest.</p><p id=eZ6DrP3Ovi6k data-wc=11><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>35 best holidays to go on with babies and toddlers</a></strong></p><h2>Take the essentials for babies and toddlers</h2><p id=eL5ffFoMuD3 data-wc=41>Most airlines will allow you to check in a stroller and a car seat at the gate for free, so take advantage of this by using them to get around the airport with your baby or toddler easier and much quicker.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Stretch your legs</h2><p id=eE7-q7qbkHlO data-wc=77>Take it in turns to get up and walk up and down the aisle every couple of hours to help children burn off any pent-up energy, keep them entertained, and stretch your legs. It’s also a good idea to encourage your children to be as active as possible at the airport before boarding your flight, to try and avoid them feeling restless early on in the journey - and maybe even tire them out enough to sleep.</p><p id=ekWAIO1A8v0e data-wc=10><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Ultimate tips and tricks for travelling with a baby</a></strong></p><h2>Dress for the occasion</h2><p id=edJ7Zh2gmQ7S data-wc=89>According to the experts at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Your Baby Club</a>, what you wear is as important as what you pack in your hand luggage. "The temperature on a plane or in a car can go from one extreme to another, one minute it can be too hot and the next it's freezing cold due to the air conditioning. You can prepare for these drastic changes in temperature by dressing yourself and your child in layers," they recommend. "Wear layers that are comfortable and can be easily removed, depending on the temperature."</p><h2>Don't forget a change of clothes</h2><p id=eQP5qhej5lqm data-wc=64>"Packing light when travelling is never easy, but one essential thing to pack when travelling by plane, car, or boat, is a change of clothes. From spilt juice to a leaky nappy, your little one may find themselves in many sticky situations when traveling, so it’s important to make sure you have a spare change of clothes just in case," the baby experts say.</p><p id=eMZJvvCIuzvC data-wc=11><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>12 screen-free activities to keep kids busy on plane journeys</a></strong></p><p id=eipDx2W7kppT data-wc=23>They add: "If you’re travelling a long distance, it’s worth packing a pair of comfortable pyjamas, to make nap time even more enjoyable."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/249135996f22-woman-packing-hand-luggage.jpg><h2>Prepare for air pressure&nbsp;</h2><p id=eRevnsN3r8US data-wc=67>"When the air pressure changes on a plane, pressure is placed on the eustachian tubes, causing pain and discomfort in the ears. This is a normal part of flying, but for young babies, this can be extremely stressful. You can relieve and prevent any pain by offering your child a bottle, breast, or pacifier to suck on during take-off and descent," the Your Baby Club team suggest.</p><p id=e54zk43e_J data-wc=13><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>What you need to pack for a holiday - 90 must-have items</a></strong></p><h2>Let go of boundaries and structure</h2><p id=ed3jXr5xRw_F data-wc=79>While you may feel like you need to stick to your usual routine and rules while travelling, Kristin Gallant and Deena Margolin, the experts behind <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Big Little Feelings</a>, say that you should let it go. "Let boundaries and structure go out the window. Seriously. Be gentle with yourself," they say. "On travel days with kids, we are all just trying to survive. This means lollipops, infinite screentime, truly whatever we need to do to make it to the destination."</p><h2>Book an extra seat&nbsp;</h2><p id=edOqDVWq555v data-wc=43>If your child is under the age of two, you are not required to book them their own seat, but should your budget allow, the Your Baby Club team recommend you do so anyway, "for their protection during take-off, landing, and through turbulence".&nbsp;</p><p id=ew3daRDr6dFm data-wc=23>They explain: "Extra room is always essential when travelling with young children on a plane, so they have room to stretch and play."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/840116a9fa5f-mother-baby-on-plane.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Don't worry about what other people think</h2><p id=eHOg9kSttVwX data-wc=60>There’s bound to be some challenging moments during a long-haul flight, especially with younger children and babies, but try not to worry too much about what other people think. You’re likely to find many other passengers are in the same position as you or may have been in the past, so they will be more understanding than you may think.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Remind yourself why you're travelling</h2><p id=eMOHU3V_omYt data-wc=69>In trickier moments, remind yourself of the reason why you’re travelling, and the trip you have to look forward to once the journey is over. Take some deep breaths and try to keep calm; regulating your emotions and avoiding getting too stressed will not only help you to handle the situation better, but it can also help your child to calm down too and nip meltdowns in the bud.</p><p id=et13yjl4a45i data-wc=22></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
