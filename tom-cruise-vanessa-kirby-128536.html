InTouch Weekly report that he is seriously smitten with newcomer Vanessa Kirby. And, in our opinion, Kirby bears a strong resemblance to one of Tom’s famous exes: Nicole Kidman.
The stars do look eerily similar, from their messy blonde hair to their piercing blue eyes."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He thinks she’s perfect to be his next wife.”</p><p>“He wants to make her the next Mrs. Tom Cruise,” they added.</p><p>While all this may seem hasty, let’s not forget that Tom and Katie publicly announced their engagement just shy of eight weeks from having first met and during this brief period, Katie even found the time to convert from Catholicism to the Church of Scientology.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=817 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/gettyimages-645134403.jpg alt=Tom-Cruise-Katie-Holmes style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Getty Images</p><p>Tom shares <a href=#>two children</a> with ex-wife Nicole Kidman: Isabella Jane Kidman Cruise, 24, and Connor Antony Cruise, 22.

He looks forward to her texts.”</p><p>Suri is reportedly not allowed to speak to her father publicly because of his position in the Scientology community.</p><p>The source added that “Katie is very concerned about Suri being brainwashed; that’s why she wanted to monitor every conversation.”</p><p>“She’s well aware of how powerful Scientology is, and she doesn’t want Tom luring Suri away from her. It’s a constant fear.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=943 height=1024 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/gettyimages-136083945.jpg alt="Tom Cruise Katie Holmes Suri Cruise" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Getty Images</p><p>The source added: “It’s not surprising that Suri is confused by the lack of communication between her parents.”</p><p>“She’s growing up, asking more questions and it’s becoming harder to shield her from the whispers. She wants to speak to her dad.”</p><p>While her relationship with her father remains the subject of much intrigue, in 2008 Tom proudly told Oprah that Suri was the centre of his universe.</p><p>It’s unknown when Tom and Suri last saw each other.</p><p>So sad!
