Billie Eilish is the latest celeb to take part in the viral &#34;Post a Picture Of&#34; Instagram challenge, but she might be the first to have lost approximately 100,000 followers because of it.
As chronicled by a fan on Twitter, Eilish's follower count slipped from 73M on the platform to 72.9M. Now, there's likely rounding to consider, and it may have nothing to do with the pictures that she shared, but regardless, it was enough of a drop to change the number, which cracked Eilish up."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The way the viral game works is that someone creates a prompt beginning with "Post a Picture Of," and then you fulfill that request.</p><p>In Eilish's case, she was prompted to share her phone's lock screen and then a drawing she was proud of. In both cases, breasts were featured prominently. Her lock screen was a painting of two nude women and the drawing was a collage of naked bodies and snakes.</p><p>On the latter, Eilish added the caption, "lol i love boobs."</p><p>She might, but apparently plenty of her followers do not. And it looks like Eilish simply does. Not.

A champion for body positivity, even as hers has come under constant and at times inappropriate scrutiny, and acceptance of one's self, there's no way she was going to back down from this truth, either.</p><p>She was just as candid and matter-of-fact when a rare photo of her in a tank top went viral, eliciting more of that inappropriate scrutiny.</p><p>"There's this picture of me running from my car to my brother’s front door on like a 110 degree day in a tank top," she told <a href=#><strong>Vanity Fair</strong></a> last month. "And people were like, 'Damn, Billie got fat!' And I’m like, 'Nope, this is how I look, you've just never seen it before!'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:700e029e-bf50-46b6-a5a0-b3d0b0c69c5a data-container-ref=toofab:article:439ce987-0ba4-47d2-afc8-58564ebc2436 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/88/5by4/2020/12/29/888f66d447324ba1b6ca834283f80e9a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Halsey Apologizes After Eating Disorder Photo Share Leads to Backlash: 'I Had Positive Intentions'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The "bad guy" singer is more commonly seen in baggy clothes, which she has admitted she does at least partially to deter unwanted commentary about her physique.</p><p>She went viral back in March for a <a href=#><strong>concert video</strong></a> she presented that was a visual poem about all the unwanted attention she -- and virtually every other woman on the planet -- is forced to endure.</p><p>And apparently for some, paintings and drawings of women's bodies are just as provocative and shocking and uncomfortable as the real thing.</p><p><strong>Got a story or tip for us?
