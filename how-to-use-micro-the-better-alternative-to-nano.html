It's simple, but lacks features included in its more complex contemporaries. <code>micro</code>&nbsp;is designed to replace nano as the text editor for the masses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=installing-micro>Installing Micro</h2><p><code>micro</code>&nbsp;isn't on</p><pre><code class=hljs>apt</code> </pre><p>&nbsp;yet, but it's only a single binary, so you can install it from its install script. Luckily, they've given it an easy-to-remember URL, which makes installing it on remote machines fairly simple:</p><pre>curl https://getmic.ro | bash</pre><p>This installs <code>micro</code>&nbsp;to the current directory, but you'll likely want to move it onto the PATH:</p><pre>mv micro /usr/local/bin/</pre><p>That's it, though if you're on macOS, you can install <code>micro</code>&nbsp;from <code>brew</code>:</p><pre>brew install micro</pre><p>If you have <code>snap</code>, <code>micro</code>&nbsp;is available there as well.</p><p>Also, some systems might not properly copy to clipboard, so you may have to install <code>xclip</code>:</p><pre>sudo apt-get install xclip</pre><p>If all else fails though, you can usually hold down Alt or Option to select the terminal text itself rather than selecting it in <code>micro</code>, if you're trying to copy out of the terminal.</p><h2 id=using-micro>Using Micro</h2><p>Part of what makes <code>micro</code>&nbsp;so good is how much we&nbsp;don't have to explain here. You use it like any other text editor when loading in a file:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><pre>micro /etc/nginx/nginx.conf</pre><p>You can create new files with this syntax, as well as taking input from pipes.</p><p>The editor itself features a notable upgrade from <code>nano</code>, with syntax highlighting for most common file types. In addition, you'll find a column for line numbers, in addition to two lines at the bottom for the UI.</p><p>One thing you'll quickly notice is that <code>micro</code>&nbsp;has proper mouse support. Unlike <code>nano</code>, you can scroll the whole window properly with the scroll wheel (rather than moving the cursor down a line), and you can click anywhere to move the cursor. You can drag to select text as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/csit/2019/10/b72ff2b8.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We would list a bunch of <code>micro</code>&nbsp;hotkeys here, but you already know them. <code>micro</code>&nbsp;uses sensible hotkeys, so rather than saving with Control+O, you can use the familiar Control+S. You can copy and paste with Control+C and Control+V.</p><p>You can easily quit the application with Control+Q (rather than pressing Esc, both foot pedals, and a glissando of keys). Exiting this way will ask you to save the modified buffer if you've made any changes, which makes saving and closing quite easy.</p><p>Micro also supports undo and redo, find and replace, and a <a href=#>bunch of commands</a>&nbsp;including support for tabs, vertical and horizontal splitting, regex support, as well as evaluating Lua expressions.</p><p>Keep in mind that if you're on a Mac, you'll still have to press Control, rather than Command, though you're likely used to that if you've used a terminal for long enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-set-micro-as-the-default-editor>How to Set Micro as The Default Editor</h2><p>Bash exposes a variable for exactly this purpose called <code>$EDITOR</code>. You can <code>echo</code>&nbsp;yours to see what it is, but you'll likely want to set it where you set other variables like <code>$PATH</code>: your <code>.bashrc</code>. This file may also be called <code>.bash_profile</code>, but it's the main entry point for whenever you create a new shell. Open it up in ... well, <code>micro</code>:</p><pre>micro .bashrc</pre><p>Then add the following line:</p><pre>export EDITOR='micro'</pre><p>You can also alias <code>micro</code>&nbsp;to something short here; <code>mc</code>&nbsp;works well:</p><pre>alias mc='micro'</pre><p>The <code>$EDITOR</code>&nbsp;variable should be respected by <code>git</code>&nbsp;(no more getting stuck in <code>vim</code>), but if it isn't, you can change it manually with:</p><pre>git config --global core.editor "micro"</pre><p>Other programs, such as <code>crontab -e</code>, will use the system default.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGibnq6fpcBwtM6wZK2nXarApnnMopqrp12ptaZ5wZ6rrZ2iYq6twMSrpZqsmauybsDOZqWapp9k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./davenport-west-baseball-looking-to-finish-the-season-on-a-high-note.html><span>←</span><span>Davenport West Baseball looking to finish the season on a high note</span></a>
