I wanted to know how she maintains her amazing complexion and, more importantly, her toned arms.</p><p>While most celebrities are treated to some of the most expensive spa treatments out there, Denise confessed she rarely even gets a facial. “I have very little free time. I will say my favorite thing of the [OROGOLD] line is the <strong>Tèrmica Mask</strong> ($598,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>orogoldcosmetics.com</a>).&nbsp;It gets really warm and heated on your face, and then I put a serum on it and it cools down. It heats up your face with all the yummy ingredients and it also helps with the collagen and anti-aging.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2013/07/denise_richards.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/revivecollagenreview.png><p>Aside from her glow, the thing that strikes me most when I see Denise are her toned arms. When asked how she maintains them, the actress said “I do Pilates, but the biggest thing that made a difference, and I’m not exaggerating, was carrying my youngest daughter for two years. Carrying her car seat, stroller, wagon — it worked out for me.”</p><p>Denise’s healthy lifestyle also includes getting beautiful from the inside out. “I’ve always had a healthy lifestyle,” she said. “And I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. Also a lot of oils — olive oils. I think avocado helps keep everything really moisturized. I have dry skin, so I try to do things that will keep my skin moisturized without breaking out.”</p><p>And when it comes to the stranger beauty trends out there, Denise doesn’t take part. “I’m not into all that. People keep telling me I need to try the fish eating your dead skin [pedicure], but I can’t do it. I’m not one who’s super adventurous and will try all these different facials and fish-eating things. I like to keep it real and natural as much as possible.”</p><p>Read more:&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Musical Duo Karmin Share Beauty Products On the Road</strong></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWSCeH6YbmtorJiaerSxwqucrWWSmrWqusNmm56mmaiybr7InJ%2BaqpSoeqi70aCcqK2jYsCstc1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vic-wreck-car-horror-crash-killed-four-teenagers-reveals-terrifying-extent-collision-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bochara crash: Wreckage of car towed as messages inside Toyota Corolla revealed</span></a>
