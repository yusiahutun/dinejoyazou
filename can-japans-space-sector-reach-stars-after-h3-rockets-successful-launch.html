The Japanese government has set a target of 30 launches a year by the early 2030s, including through private space ventures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The satellite launch market is booming,” said Morinosuke Kawaguchi, a technology analyst and consultant, who was previously a lecturer at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Countries in the ‘Global South’ can develop satellites but do not have the means to get them into orbit and with launches from Russia now much more difficult and US pressure on China, this is a very promising situation for Japan,” Kawaguchi said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">JAXA and MHI need to show that the H-IIA’s strong features in terms of reliability would also be reflected in the H3, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They need to show again and again that the H3 is a stable delivery vehicle and build up that credibility.
