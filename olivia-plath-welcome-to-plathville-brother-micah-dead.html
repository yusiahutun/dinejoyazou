"Don't worry if you don't see me around — I'm taking some space now," she wrote (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>), "I lost a younger brother last night to an unexpected accident and I need some clarity and space for grieving."</p><p>On Tuesday, she also told her followers she was still "on a social media break due to a family death."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ca659d18-efe6-474e-81ee-51a51c65e19b data-container-ref=toofab:article:dcae64af-58df-46e6-bb68-94488d4cbbc7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a4/5by4/2023/05/02/a4e84f3d0e5b4170a502124b7cd07188_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Allison Holker Speaks Out in First Interview After Husband Stephen 'TWitch' Boss' Death</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Roanoke Times</a>, Olivia's 15-year-old brother Micah Meggs died last Thursday, May 4, after he was struck by a car while riding an electric bike. Both the teen and the car were reportedly in the same lane, heading in the same direction, when the accident occurred around 10pm. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>The incident is being investigated by state police.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In his obituary</a>, Micah was remembered as a "fun loving" individual whose "intrepid determination characterized his life." The teenager was the ninth of ten children and "enjoyed spending his time outdoors hunting, fishing, camping and trapping, and became a skilled outdoorsman."</p><p>He also "loved to hang out with his siblings and a few close friends, playing practical jokes, sharing his understated sense of humor and bringing laughs to those he loved." While his family noted Meggs had Cerebral Palsy, he "never complained or let himself be limited by his disability and continually found ways to pursue his outdoor activities despite this struggle." They said he devoted a lot of his time recently helping others who also suffered from Brachial Plexus injuries.</p><p>"Micah brought tremendous light, laughter and love into every life he touched and his presence will be greatly missed," they shared, asking for donations to be made to The United Brachial Plexus Network in lieu of flowers.</p><p>The teen's funeral will be held on May 11.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25mamhfpLmqwsiaZKmkkam1bsPEpZqopZViwbB5z6WYraCmnrmtsYybqaismJq%2FbrnInJihZZSarqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wayno-clark-and-brandra-ringo-join-quality-control-music-as-vp-and-evp-of-ar.html><span>←</span><span>Wayno Clark and Brandra Ringo Join Quality Control Music as VP and EVP of A&amp;amp;R</span></a>
