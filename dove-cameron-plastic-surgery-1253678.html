A lot of famous personalities are often rumored to have had plastic surgery. While some of them choose to do it to enhance their appearance and better their career, others do it to uphold the current beauty standards. Dove Cameron, the multi-talented sensation, has been no exception to this phenomenon. She is known for her roles in Disney Channel's “Descendants” and “Glee”. People admire her for her beautiful, glowing skin and youthful appearance, and they're curious about how she manages to stay looking so good. Dove Cameron's plastic surgery transformations have sparked discussions and curiosity among fans and media.</p><p>Unlike many well-known stars such as Kylie Jenner and Bella Hadid who openly admitted to having cosmetic procedures at a young age, Dove Cameron, who is 27 years old, is another celebrity who may have quietly undergone cosmetic enhancements without gaining much attention. Besides her acting skills, the actress gained praise for her amazing skin over the years, and even today, we haven't seen many others on the red carpet with skin as flawless as hers!</p><p>This beautiful Hollywood sensation is known for her large eyes, long eyelashes, full lips, and petite button nose. However, her evolving appearance in recent times made her fans wonder whether it’s all because of hairstyling and makeup or if Dove has also made enhancements to her facial features. So, whether you've been a fan for a long time or just simply wanted to decode the truth behind the gossip of her cosmetic enhancements, keep reading to know the story of Dove’s beautiful skin.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2><strong>Who is Dove Cameron?</strong></h2><p><img alt=best-neon-nail-polish title=best-neon-nail-polish width=387 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1698231599_shutterstock_1547651243-1.jpg></p><p>Born on January 15, 1996, in Seattle, Washington, USA, Chloe Celeste Hosterman was raised in a family with a strong interest in the arts. Her father, Philip Alan Hosterman, is a jewelry designer, and her mother, Bonnie Wallace, is an author and actress. Dove Cameron began her acting career at a young age, performing in local community theater productions in Washington State. In 2012, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue her acting career more seriously.</p><p>She adopted the stage name "Dove Cameron" after her father encouraged her to choose a unique and memorable name for her career. She chose "Dove" because it's a symbol of peace and "Cameron" as a nod to her family's Scottish heritage.</p><p>Dove Cameron's breakthrough came when she performed the dual lead role of "Liv and Maddie" in the Disney Channel series which aired from 2013 to 2017. This role brought her widespread recognition and a dedicated fan following. She has also performed in Disney Channel original movies, including the "Descendants" that further made her win the limelight as a Disney Channel star.</p><p>The actress also won an Emmy Award in the year 2018 for her outstanding performances in some of the major Disney movies. Besides her acting prowess, Dove Cameron has also stepped into music and has appeared in various stage productions. Her music career has allowed her to explore her talents as a singer and songwriter.</p><p>Throughout her career, Dove Cameron has gained much appreciation for her performances and has become a popular personality among young audiences for her talent and charisma. She's still working on movies and music, making sure she stays a part of the entertainment world.</p><h2><strong>Did Dove Cameron Get Plastic Surgery?</strong></h2><p><img alt=best-neon-nail-polish title=best-neon-nail-polish width=333 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1698231600_shutterstock_1475554418-1-1.jpg></p><p>During an interview with StyleCaster, Cameron openly talked about her struggle with anorexia and the pressure to fit into society's beauty standards. As the pressure to look more beautiful increased, Dove was also feeling stressed. Many people believe that this might be one of the biggest reasons that she underwent plenty of cosmetic procedures. Some people believe that Cameron had plastic surgery because her appearance has changed since the mid-2000s. Many of her fans noticed a significant difference in her lips when she appeared in “Liv And Maddie” in 2010. She was 17 years old at the time, and it's possible that she got lip fillers because her lips appeared to have changed since 2008. In 2014, people have speculated again as they have witnessed a huge difference in her upper lip, raising questions that the actress has again undergone lip fillers.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>But these speculations didn't end there. In 2019, there were observations of significant changes in Dove's cheeks and chin as well. Many people have commented on her pictures asking if she has added dimples through cosmetic surgeries along with rhinoplasty. Dove Cameron's face has evolved over the years. From cheek fillers to very less wrinkles and a pointed nose – the actress and singer’s facial features have undergone noticeable changes which left the air filled with gossip about whether she has had cosmetic procedures done or is just skilled in makeup techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, Dove has never publicly admitted to having plastic surgery. She chooses to keep herself tight-lipped even in the matter of lip and cheek fillers. While it's possible that she has undergone some procedures, she may have chosen to keep it private. Fans have been commenting and questioning why she looks different, but we aren’t certain. The actress knows that people are talking about her, but it seems that she may not want to address these rumors.</p><h2><strong>What Plastic Surgery Has Dove Cameron Had?</strong></h2><p>Over the years, Cameron has maintained her youthful and radiant skin. Some significant changes in her facial features have also been witnessed in the journey. Let’s take a look at Dove Cameron's transformation and speculated plastic surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Dove Cameron Nose Job</strong></h3><p>If you compare photos of this well-known Hollywood celebrity from when she first started out in the industry back in 2008, you might notice that her nose appears unusually large. This bump on her nose vanished in the year 2018 and the tip of the nose became more structured and shorter which is typically the outcome of nose surgery. A nose job is a cosmetic surgery done to make the nose look better by changing its shape.</p><p>When it comes to Dove Cameron's nose job, the surgeon may have taken away extra skin from the nose bridge and changed its shape by removing extra fat. Various methods and tactics may have been used to change the shape of her nose. Sometimes, surgeons also remove a bit of cartilage from either side of the nose to boost the appearance and make it more chiseled. The most common way to make someone's nose smaller is through a surgery called rhinoplasty. In this surgery, the doctor tightens muscles around the lower part of the nose and moves it upward to make it smaller or give it a different shape.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><img alt=best-neon-nail-polish title=best-neon-nail-polish width=339 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1698231600_shutterstock_1543138949-1.jpg></p><h3><strong>Dove Cameron’s Lip Filler</strong></h3><p>It is quite noticeable that Dove Cameron may have gotten lip fillers when you look at her pictures from when she was a child actress. She seems to have increased the size of her lips and likely gets filler injections regularly, perhaps every six months. To tackle the fine lines and wrinkles on the lips, these cosmetic injections seem to have been used to add collagen fibers to the lips. Lips fillers work well for women whose lips have become thinner due to getting older, smoking, or other factors that affect the skin. If you look at Dove Cameron before lip fillers, she had extremely lesser volume, especially on the upper lip. But if you see her lips now, both of her appear fuller, younger, juicy, and plumped.</p><h3><strong>Dove Cameron’s Botox</strong></h3><p>People have been talking about the youthful, tight, and glowing skin that Dove possesses. While some say that she might have gotten facial implants, others are contemplating that she might have used face fillers or Botox to maintain such radiant skin. Her pictures are often edited to make it seem like she had cosmetic work, but we can't be sure if those images are real or fake unless we know exactly what she did in real life. There might be a high chance that the actress underwent Botox fillers as there are no fine lines or wrinkles present on her face. Botox is injected into the facial muscles to make one appear younger and more relaxed – it can also be used to lessen swelling under the eyes, make the wrinkles around the mouth look smoother, and relax the facial muscles that lead to the upper eyelid drooping too much.</p><p><img alt=best-neon-nail-polish title=best-neon-nail-polish width=314 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1698231600_shutterstock_2317460895-1.jpg></p><h3><strong>Blepharoplasty</strong></h3><p>Dove Cameron's face surgery has been abuzz on the internet. Because of the smoother and improved face contouring, people have been speculating about the odds of facelift surgery. Besides botox injections on her face and neck, she might have undergone facelift surgery on her upper and lower eyelids, lips, jawline, and the area between the nose and mouth, known as the nasolabial fold.</p><p>The wrinkles around Dove's eyes have changed a lot over the years, and her eyelids look quite different from when she was younger. She might have gotten fillers or might have had eyelid surgery aka Blepharoplasty to create that cat-like upward curve on the outer corners of her eyes. She may also have chosen cheek augmentation or cheek or chin implants as her dimples are quite prominent in the older years.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><img alt=best-neon-nail-polish title=best-neon-nail-polish width=334 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1698231601_shutterstock_167971514-1.jpg></p><h3><strong>Dove Cameron’s Boob Job</strong></h3><p>Dove has a great body that looks truly beautiful! What's posing questions about the breast augmentation procedure is the fact that Dove's chest doesn't seem to change much even when her weight changes. It's possible that Dove Cameron had breast augmentation surgery to change the size of her breasts. Though she had naturally voluminous breasts from the beginning, she might have used breast augmentation surgery to maintain them as she grew older. There are chances that she could be using push-up bras and good posing to enhance her look as well. As the actress hasn’t made any official statements, it is quite difficult to know for sure.</p><h2><strong>Dove Cameron Before And After Surgery</strong><strong> Pictures</strong></h2><p>People are always interested in seeing how celebrities look before and after plastic surgery, and for Dove Cameron, it’s no different. You'll find many pictures online comparing Dove Cameron then and now and<strong> </strong>how she transformed over the years. When you look at these pictures, you'll notice that the changes in Cameron are very subtle but not very hard to notice.
