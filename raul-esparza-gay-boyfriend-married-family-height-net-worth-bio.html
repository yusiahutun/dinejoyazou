His father came from a family of engineers and it was only natural that he became an engineer. His mother has only a handful when it comes to work, as she always seems to do – to work. When she wasn’t a banker in the bank hall, she worked as an interior designer or in a travel agency.</p><p>His family moved around a lot, and not only that but his parents were also fighting. America García Pell, his maternal grandmother, moved in with them when he was 5 years old, providing unconditional love that he could not get from his parents, and practically raising him.</p><p>In 1993 he married his high school sweetheart Michele Marie Perez but was divorced in 2008. Why? The divorce came two years after he revealed his sexual orientation as bisexual and his same-sex relationship in the New York Times profile in 2006. This could be a possible reason or a contributing factor to the separation.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tracy Morgan Wife, Kids, What Happened After The Accident, Net Worth</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Raúl Esparza Gay? Who is his Boyfriend?</strong></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, the Hannibal actor revealed that he has both same-sex and opposite-sex relationships. Therefore, he can be classified as bisexual.</p><p>When he was in his second year of college, he fell in love with a male lecturer, a composer who was only a few years older than him. After graduating, the man helped him to audition in Chicago for the Remains Theatre Company, which eventually gave him a job.</p><p>Raúl Esparza said the lecturer inspired him to become a great star and also believed he would become one, adding that he made him feel like a great person no matter what he did. After his trainer committed suicide in 1998, the actor told the company that he had a reason to be fully informed about everything he was hiding from, including his sexual orientation. He added that it was not about where he was or what he was doing, but rather who he was.</p><p>Although he married his wife because he loved her, he considered it a naive decision. He was known to have had affairs after separating from his wife and going out with some men. He has stated that he is bisexual and there are rumors that he is dating basketball player Nick Mayo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The actor with excellent performances is very successful and must have accumulated a corresponding fortune.
