I’m genuinely not sad because I know the alternative for them is death. My book, , will help the cause of the dogs by spreading the word about their plight – it could rally a lot of people to get behind the mission. I’ve got 18 dogs living with me in Koh Samui, Thailand. One had an ear cut off in an operation and there are three puppies, another dog with cancer and some old dogs. They are all looking for homes and some of them are on their way to homes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/124a2652200c-niall-harbison-sits-with-dogs.jpg><p id=ewp81VMRjU7 data-wc=98>I’ve always loved dogs; I had three myself but I started feeding the dogs on the streets. Then I realised I had to go back the next day, because I thought: "They're waiting for me and they’ll build up a dependence on me." It wasn’t just food they needed; they also required medicine and trips to the vets. I quickly ended up feeding around 80 dogs every day; that was a year ago. Now I’m up to 800 every day, with a team of volunteers, and we sterilise 200 dogs each month. It mushroomed into a huge project.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Makeup helped me explore my masculinity and find true happiness" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2402afde3638-image2-2.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Makeup helped me explore my masculinity and find true happiness" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Makeup helped me explore my masculinity and find true happiness</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Do you need an awe break?

When they were dying, I said to them: "I'll continue this work – I’m not going to let you down." I told Tina about the hospital I'm going to build in her name, and then to Snoop – who was with me for a long time, through my depression and drinking – I said: "I'll see you in the future. I won’t be back drinking. I will fulfil the mission in your name." I promised it to them and that’s not a promise I could ever break.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f5dc92b91790-niall-harbison-with-dogs.jpg><p id=eLk3YDJY_om data-wc=102>Making changes in all the dogs' names is the most important part. The hospital is for Tina and it’s a wonderful legacy because she’s a street dog who was going to die on her own. Now, there is going to be a hospital that does dozens of operations on dogs every week. Tina was a dog on a really short chain who had been used to have loads of puppies. When we got her out, she was blossoming and she was such a character. Even though she only got six months of pure joy in her life, she made a huge impression.</p><figure class="quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-news -style-2"><p id=e_jvYtXERPg>I wish I could bottle the feeling and give it to dog lovers around the world</p></figure><p id=e0O1FXGThNe data-wc=55>Some days you do save a dog’s life.
