He managed the feat thanks to gastric band surgery and a change in his diet and exercise regime.</p><p>”This has definitely been a life changing procedure for me," he said. "I feel one hundred percent better in myself and am reaping the benefits of weight loss.</p><p>"I feel healthier, I have more confidence in myself and am enjoying being able to do so many more activities. It’s also great to be able to buy clothes in normal sizes."</p><p>Two years ago David weighed just over 20st and&nbsp;wore 52 inch chest jackets and his waist measured 44 inches. &nbsp;Having suffered from weight issues since he was a child, he tried hard to keep his weight under control through diet and exercise.</p><p>However, following the death of his father four years ago David turned to comfort eating and started piling on the pounds. &nbsp;Low self-esteem also&nbsp;contributed to his weight gain.</p><p>At 6ft tall David carried his weight well and&nbsp;managed to avoid other weight realted illnesses&nbsp;but he felt excruciatingly self-conscious of his body.</p><p>“I was always a healthy large person, I never had problems with blood pressure or any other weight related issues,” he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19715659.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_44832><p>But the extra weight he had piled on then triggered back pain, which made it difficult for him to exercise causing his weight to further increase.</p><p>Then in May 2011, while on holiday in Devon, David read an article about a female celebrity who lost 7st after gastric band surgery and this spurred him to take action. After much deliberation he decided to look into having the gastric band procedure doneand his GP recommended he have surgery locally at Spire Leeds Hospital.</p><p>David chose to have the procedure done by Simon Dexter, a consultant in upper gastrointestinal and minimally invasive surgery, who explained the options best suited to David’s condition. “I chose gastric band weight loss surgery rather than a bypass as I did not want anything permanent or too drastic,” said David.</p><p>Gastric band surgery, reduces the capacity of your stomach using an adjustable band so that you can only eat small meals. The band is placed around the upper part of your stomach and contains a circular balloon, similar to a tiny tube, which is then inflated through a port placed just under your skin. This creates a pouch of stomach above the band. When you eat, the pouch fills up quickly and the band then slows down the passage of food into the lower part of your stomach. The food then travels normally through the rest of your digestive system.</p><p>A gastric bypass is a more extreme procedure where your digestive system is re-routed past most of your stomach so you digest less food and it takes much less food to make you feel full.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19676453.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_44833><p>David had the band fitted in September 2011 and adopted a healthy diet and exercise regime which saw the weight drop off steadily until he was a trim 11st 11lb.</p><p>After losing 80% of his excess weight David is delighted with his new look and is enjoying his new found confidence. “I’ve just been on holiday in Marbella and was able to take my top off on the beach. Something I would not have dreamt of doing before.”</p><p>His surgeon&nbsp;Mr. Dexter said: “David was very committed to getting control of his weight and this motivation made him a good candidate for surgery. It is possible to regain weight after any weight loss procedure, but the procedure should only be part of a process of lifestyle change and an altered relationship with food. David has done well, because he has learnt to work with the band to enable him to improve his diet.”</p><p>David has been so successful with his weight loss that he elected to have a tummy tuck to reduce the excess skin and tighten abdominal muscles.</p><p>With his new found confidence and slimmed-down physique David is hoping to finally find that someone special.</p><p>Obesity is one of the biggest health challenges facing the UK, with 61.3 per cent of adults and 30 per cent of children aged between two and 15 overweight or obese.</p><p>For more information on controlling your weight visit gov.uk</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaJyZmsFussitpZ6ro2S5prHDrGSmmZ5iubC%2F02alnpmiocZutMClnWZpaGuAc4GYcQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saul-steinberg-businessman.html><span>←</span><span>Saul Steinberg (businessman) Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth and Family</span></a>
