Given her present-day viral success, those <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeCvsXf5jb0" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tweenage videos" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">tweenage videos</a>—in which she sports a “Wanna make rock?” graphic tank top—seem almost prophetic. “Since a young age, I have been on social media. It has been something that is so natural to me,” the singer-songwriter tells Harper’s Bazaar from her hometown of Johannesburg, South Africa.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Ever since I could remember, I always gravitated toward music and dance. I loved watching artists on TV,” she says. “I just always saw myself there.” Tyla’s vision for herself was apparent from the start, even if the masses were slower to catch on. Her breakthrough debut music video, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Tct3AAre0" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Getting Late,”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Getting Late,”</a> showcased her now-signature dance moves, garnered millions of views, and gave her the notoriety every new artist needs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With a buzzing single and burgeoning TikTok following (she can reach <strong></strong>over 100 million views on just one post), Tyla soon found herself signing a joint contract with Flourish and Multiply (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/fax.ny/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=FAX class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>FAX</u></a>) and Epic Records. Within a few years, she had toured with industry peers across Europe, and released a handful of new songs, like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7C6FhmE37M" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Girl Next Door”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Girl Next Door”</a> with Ayra Starr. Finally, she reemerged this summer with her first certified hit, “Water.” Its infectious chorus—“Make me sweat, make me hotter / Make me lose my breath, make me water”—became inescapable, strengthened by fellow African choreographer Litchi’s TikTok <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/waterdance?lang=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=#WaterDance class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>#WaterDance</u></a> challenge. Their trending routine has exceeded 554 million views on the app, driving eyes toward the singer’s Bacardi-inspired twerks and the place Tyla is proudest of: South Africa.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Where I am from is everything. It is who I am. It is my sound. It is the way I dance. It is the way I talk,” she says. “South Africa is literally me as an artist. I am bringing it wherever I go.”</p><img alt=tyla title=tyla width=1920 height=1877 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/press-201-final-ready-full-300dpi-r2-hr-656a258c80342.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeremy Soma</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her consistent emphasis on where she comes from and her intonation have drawn comparisons to Rihanna’s 2005 debut, Music of the Sun, with some supporters even dubbing Tyla the Barbadian superstar’s “daughter.” It is evident that Tyla has studied the billionaire musician and mogul’s blueprint, and she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/navybih/status/1728141088576213149?s=20" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="credits Rihanna" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>credits Rihanna</u></a> as one of her biggest inspirations. Her upcoming "Truth or Dare" music video was filmed in the Caribbean, and any likeness noted between the two performers is presumably one of the best compliments the newcomer could receive concerning her potential longevity.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the South African house variant amapiano gains popularity, Tyla and her cross-genre catalog strive to center the beauty of her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Coloured data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Coloured class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Coloured</a> heritage and African music for supporters of all backgrounds. When we discuss what she wants her growing fan base to know, her reply is straightforward: “I want them to know about our culture in general and our source. The music is not just music to us. It is very spiritual for us … Good music is a part of us. Realize this.” There is conviction in her voice, and she takes a moment to point toward other talents she is “always listening to” from her continent—namely, her countryman and collaborator Kelvin Momo, as well as Nigerian singer-songwriter Wizkid.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like many, Tyla is also a self-proclaimed <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a43265249/tems-getting-ready-oscars-2023/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Tems class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Tems</u></a> stan. In a recent <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy6PbWEo-R4/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="radio interview" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>radio interview</u></a>, she acknowledged the origin of her inspiration: “She’s an African woman. She’s killing the game. Like, globally. Everybody loves her… She’s just becoming a role model for other African female artists.” In an industry that thrives on pitting women in music against one another—especially Black women—Tyla and Tems’s mutual admiration is crucial. It’s a reminder there is room for everyone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beyond the two singers’ shared love for African artistry is a new experience in common: Both are nominated for the forthcoming <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a45811405/2024-grammy-nominations/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="66th Annual Grammy Awards" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>66th Annual Grammy Awards</u></a>. The occasion marks Tyla’s first nomination in the Best African Music Performance category, for “Water.” Though the amorous song currently sits atop Billboard’s U.S. Afrobeats Songs Chart, less well known than the vocalist are her powerhouse collaborators: Sammy Soso, who did production work, and contributing writer Tricky Stewart. (The latter has worked with icons like Beyoncé, Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige, Rihanna, and Mariah Carey.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Portions of her debut LP have been recorded in multiple countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, Ghana, and the United States. That global influence permeates her upcoming album, set for release in 2024. Tyla’s new songs—<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBbfGilv7kI" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“On and On,”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“On and On,”</a> “Truth or Dare,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APGmBPc1R64" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=“Butterflies,” class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Butterflies,”</a> and the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3sR1482wqQ" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Water (Remix)”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Water (Remix)”</a> with Travis Scott—are available now for fans who preorder her upcoming self-titled album. Her airy voice floats above melodies, detailing how love went wrong and the joy of finding someone new. She is clearly well on her way to the global stardom she’s striving for.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her diverse approach to production and choice of collaborators ultimately fuel what she considers her “popiano” sound, a fusion of pop and amapiano influences, such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/kwaito data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="kwaito music" data-vars-ga-product-id=24ddffd5-2eb7-41c5-a8b9-bc50e04dbcb7 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/kwaito data-product-url=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/kwaito data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterclass.com%2Farticles%2Fkwaito" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=62142e84-34bf-473a-9b80-2694ef75bc1a class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">kwaito music</a>. “I just love mixing R&B and pop with African production. That is my favorite type of music,” Tyla says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though celebrated for her bubbly persona on social media, there is greater depth to her budding talent—this musical moment has been years in the making. Tyla scripts her videos’ storyboards, is hands-on with her stylist, pens songs from personal experiences, and more importantly, understands the value of teamwork. “Obviously, I enjoy doing things by myself. But I always find that I enjoy collaborating with people. I enjoy those sessions more. It is more creative. I am able to bounce [ideas] off of people. Then, people can bounce off of me,” she says. “I love getting inspiration and sharing where I am from and things about my life and culture.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The person most responsible for instilling these values in her also helped establish the breezy style that launched Tyla’s career—it was her mother. The singer would raid her mom’s closet as a tyke, hoping to emulate her beauty. “I love fashion … I would wear all my mother’s clothes, heels, shoes, and everything. I would model for my family … I really grew up looking up to my mother and loving the way she carried herself,” she says. While brand names are not yet a major focal point for her at this stage, being put together is. As with her music, Tyla’s style is more concentrated <strong></strong>on execution than anything else. So far, the performer has worn looks from Gen Z–adored brands Di Petsa and Blumarine, which have caught fans’ attention. As we have learned over the years, fashion is nearly as vital in building a superstar as music.</p><img alt=tyla title=tyla width=1520 height=1920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/231007-tyla-sony-music-04-008-v2-hr-656a2944f0ad9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeremy Soma</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That sentiment was showcased on social media recently through a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://youtube.com/shorts/Swr2_AY90qs?si=p3mmRNJyKHVRp8av" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=snippet class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">snippet</a> of her video for “Truth or Dare,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/C0EeJumIo5p/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="filmed in Jamaica" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">filmed in Jamaica</a>, with creative direction from Thato Nzimande. The single’s emphasis on how exes play themselves only to regret it later carries weight with Tyla’s audiences. The lyrics (“So, let’s play truth or dare / Dare you to forget / That you used to treat me just like anyone”) remind listeners that women with their own things going on are at liberty to hold romantic partners accountable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tyla confirms that she writes about what she is familiar with. “A lot of the new songs I relate to,” she says. “With my songs, I just do storytelling … I do find myself in all the music that I make.” Her eyes are set on having it all, and why not?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She is not afraid to voice what she wants out of fame. “I want to become the biggest pop star and to advocate for Africa and African music wherever I go. That would make me feel like I have made it,” she says. Among her dream collaborators are Rihanna, PartyNextDoor, Drake, and Blackpink, to name a few. Her passion and purpose have led her this far, and will continue propelling her forward.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As she puts it: “I am so ready for everything that is to come.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/07aedf7b-183e-401c-b96e-635e08fbfffd_1677175058.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Alysse" title="Headshot of Bianca Alysse" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Alysse is a Bronx-born author and editor who has written for Rolling Stone, Roc Nation, Harper's BAZAAR, Universal Music Group, Esquire, Sony Music Entertainment, SpringHill Company, Warner Music Group, Billboard, XO, New York Fashion Week, REVOLT TV, and others.
