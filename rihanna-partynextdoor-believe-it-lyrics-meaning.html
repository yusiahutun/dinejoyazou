The song marks Rihanna’s grand return to music after her 2016 track “Lemon” with N.E.R.D. In the song, PartyNextDoor sings about how his love interest needs to forgive him after a screwup a “long time ago” in their relationship.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/asap-rihanna.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jennifer-lopez-rihanna.png><p>“First you gotta forgive me,” he sings. “Let me know everything gon’ be okay Even if I come out with everything I did Would you still punish me even though I did it a long time ago?”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>As for Rihanna, the Barbadian songstress isn’t <a href=# rel=noopener>featured in the song</a> as much as we hoped, but she does provide vocals for track’s infectious chorus: “Best make me believe it. Best make me believe it. Believe you won’t deceive me.”</p><p>“Believe Me,” which was cowritten by Rihanna, comes after fans have pressured Rihanna to <a href=# rel=noopener>release new music.</a> (The last album the singer has released was 2016’s Anti.)&nbsp; In 2018, Rihanna assured fans in her Instagram comments that new music from her would <a href=# rel=noopener>come out in 2019</a>. When 2020 rolled around, fans were disappointed to learn that they’d have to wait even longer for new Rih tunes. However, it may not be long now. Since the year started, Rihanna has posted several photos of her recording studio, which hints that a new album (or at least a new song) from the “Pon de Replay” singer could be coming out any day now.</p><p>We (and the rest of the Rihanna navy) are waiting with bated breath.</p><p>Read the full lyrics to Rihanna and PartyNextDoor’s “Believe Me” below.</p><p class=p2><span class=s1>[Chorus:
