Whether you’re an astrology convert or a loyal skeptic, you can’t argue with cold, hard numbers — and the richest zodiac signs in the world have been revealed. Turns out, you can read some clear patterns in a new Forbes list of this year’s top billionaires.&nbsp;</p><p>Financial experts at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Merchant Cash Advance</a> analyzed the<strong> </strong>top 300 billionaires from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a><a href=#> Billionaires 2022</a> rich list — including titans of industry Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos — to see which zodiac signs were common among the world’s wealthiest figures. Keep reading to learn how likely you might be to strike it rich based on your astrological positioning.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Forbes Rich List Findings</h2><p>In order to determine the richest horoscopes in the world, Merchant Cash Advance experts noted Forbes‘ top 300 billionaires and their star signs, net worth, country, and age. Those whose specific dates of births could not be found were removed from the data set, totaling 32 — which means the final number of billionaires analyzed was 268.</p><p>Life isn’t always fair, but the airy scales of justice came out on top in finances: Libras dominated the list as the most common star sign, with a total of 32 billionaires born between September 22 and October 23, including Ralph Lauren and Alice Walton. Watery fish Pisces ranked second, with 29 billionaires birthdays worldwide. Taurus came next, with 27 billionaires; then Leo, with 24; and rounding out the top five was <a href=#>Aries</a>, with 22.&nbsp;</p><p>The signs with the least number of billionaires on the Forbes list were Capricorn (with 15), Scorpio (17), and Aquarius (20).&nbsp;</p><p>There were anomalies, of course. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk — CEO of SpaceX, Tesla, and most recently, Twitter — is a <a href=#>Cancer</a>, which only ranked as the ninth most common sign for billionaires. The star sign of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world’s second richest man, is another surprise: He’s a Capricorn, which is the least successful star sign (according to this wealth metric), with a comparably small 15 billionaires on the list.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is success written in the stars?&nbsp;</h2><p>Astrology is a pseudoscience, so we obviously cannot use this data to prove anything concrete. However, we can absolutely speculate as to why each of these signs is destined for fame and fortune. Allow me to explore the money-making qualities of the top four billionaire zodiac signs: Libra, Pisces, Taurus, and Leo.</p><p><strong>Libra</strong>. It’s not hard to imagine <a href=#>why Libra would top the billionaires list</a>. People who fall under this sign, represented by the Scales, are known for being balanced (of course), charming, and likable. A Libra can easily play both sides of the field — therefore, convincing an investor to fund their bright ideas should be no sweat. Libras also tend to be impressionable and easy to influence; but by the same token, they love to team up and collaborate, so perhaps the secret to success lies in staying open to outside ideas and cooperating well with others. Libras are an air sign — these are the “intellectuals” of the zodiac — and bound by endless curiosity. Their love of beauty, art, and culture typically translates into a broader interest in the world around them, which is a useful quality in a visionary or leader. The top Libra on the Forbes list is Alice Walton, who ranks as the 18th richest person in the world with a net worth of $65.3 billion at the age of 72. Alice is the only daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton, and she’s the second richest woman in the world.</p><p><strong>Pisces</strong>. <a href=#>The water sign Pisces</a> often produces dreamers and visionaries. The Fish, representing those born between February 19 and March 20, is known for imagination and creativity — and as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">12th and final sign</a> on the zodiac karmic wheel, it’s often said that Pisces have learned all the lessons and absorbed all the qualities of the signs that came before. This makes Pisces the eldest and wisest of the bunch. Some less-than-ideal Piscean qualities include a lack of boundaries and a tendency toward co-dependence or passivity — in other words, it’s hard for them to say “no.” Then again, saying “yes” might explain their wealth. Their reliance on escapism, too, could be what catapults a Pisces from day-dreaming to achieving real world success. Piscean entrepreneur Bernard Arnault is the third richest man in the world, with a net worth of $158 billion; he’s the co-founder, chairman, and chief executive of the world’s largest luxury goods company LVMH, which includes Louis Vuitton and Sephora.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Taurus</strong>. Another no-brainer: The Bull is renowned for being dependable, hardworking, and stubborn. <a href=#>Tauruses also tend to be extremely money-motivated</a> and materialistic — not necessarily out of greed, but rather because they relish their creature comforts. A Taurus wants to live a life of luxury, keeping good food, drink, and amenities within easy reach; and having money is an important part of reaching that goal. The dog-on-a-bone mentality that sometimes makes arguing with a Taurus feel like arguing with a wall could also be beneficial when striking business deals and pushing things forward professionally, despite obstructions. The richest of the Taureans is Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder of the social media website Facebook and Meta Platforms. Worth $67.3 billion, Zuckerberg is the 15th richest billionaire on the Forbes list — and at the tender age of 38.</p><p><strong>Leo</strong>. Libras might assume they are the zodiac’s most prolific charmers, but Leos give them a run for their money (literally, in this case). <a href=#>The mighty Lion is ruled by the Sun</a>, and their attitudes are every bit as bold and bright. Leos are confident, natural-born leaders who enjoy being the center of attention — one of the reasons they excel as entertainers and performers. They are also very generous, which you might assume would result in giving money away — but clearly, generosity has its place in big business. Leos are vain, and care deeply about what other people think of them — a quality which possibly spurs them to work harder in a bid to impress others. Leo Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, claimed the seventh position on the Forbes billionaire list with a net worth of $107 billion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is “failure” written in the stars?</h2><p>And what of the signs with the least number of billionaires: Capricorn, Scorpio, and Aquarius? We can theorize as to why these astrological placements fall lower on the wealth chain, too.</p><p><strong>Capricorn</strong>. Extremely hard-working and money-oriented, these Sea Goats buckle down in their younger years; but they actually grow less preoccupied with ambition <a href=#>as they age</a>. Additionally, they’re serious-minded and not always the life of the party — and judging by the data, charm is a huge help when it comes to scoring billionaire status.</p><p><strong>Scorpio. </strong><a href=#>This intense water sign’s</a> lack of financial superiority is a little more unexpected, because they are so cunning and skilled at manipulation, which you’d think would be beneficial when wheeling and dealing; still, Scorpions prefer behind-the-scenes power, without all the glitz and limelight, which doesn’t often translate into becoming the CEO of a company.</p><p><strong>Aquarius</strong>. <a href=#>Water-bearing Aquarians</a> are known as the humanitarians of the zodiac; a bit emotionally aloof but extremely socially conscious, they care far more about benefiting the collective than chasing after financial wealth for themselves. (Perhaps none of these three signs are ruthless enough to pursue monetary gains, and would prefer to give their cash away than to hoard it.)</p><p>Ultimately, your date of birth doesn’t predict your future. For most of us, money comes and goes — we know we’ll never reach billionaire status. Still, with work ethic, determination, and vision, we can secure lives for ourselves that at least hold purpose and meaning… if not wealth beyond our wildest dreams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJon6iqn6iwsLzErGazp5SerqR50qKep6tdl7atuMiopZqhoprAbrLOq5meq12ntqS0jKWgrKw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./over-the-top-mushroom-quiche.html><span>←</span><span>over-the-top mushroom quiche</span></a>
