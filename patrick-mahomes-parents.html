Patrick, whose full name is Patrick Lavon Mahomes II, shares a name with his father, whose Patrick Lavon Mahomes Sr. As some NFL fans may know, Mahomes Jr. isn’t the only athlete in his family. His father was a professional baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1992 to 2003. In that time, Pat played for teams like the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets. Patrick also has three siblings: younger brother Jackson Mahomes and younger half-sisters Mia Randall and Zoe Mahomes.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>His father’s career is part of the reason that Patrick played baseball in his early sports career. In high school, Patrick played baseball, basketball and football. His high school football coach told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Yahoo Sports</a> in 2020 that him playing baseball and basketball actually made him better as a quarterback. Patrick went on to play both baseball and football in college at Texas Tech University, switching on and off between seasons.</p><p>In his junior year of college, Patrick announced that he would be retiring from baseball to focus on football. A year later, in January 2017, Patrick revealed that he was forgoing his final year in college to enter the NFL draft and play football professionally. He was eventually chosen as the quarterback for the <a rel=noopener href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> in 2017 and won his first <a rel=noopener href=#>Super Bowl</a> in 2020.</p><p>So that’s Patrick’s NFL career in a nutshell. But who are <a href=# rel=noopener>Patrick Mahomes’ parents</a> and what his relationship like with them? Find out everything you need to know about <a href=# id=auto-tag_patrick-mahomes data-tag=patrick-mahomes>Patrick Mahomes</a>‘ parents ahead.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-patrick-mahomes-father-pat-mahomes>Who is Patrick Mahomes’ father, Pat Mahomes?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pat-mahomes.png><p>Pat Mahomes is Mahomes’ father. The two share the same name: Patrick Lavon Mahomes. Like his son, Pat was also a professional athlete. He played as a professional pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1992 to 2003. In his almost 10 years as a professional baseball player, Pat played for the Minnesota Twins, the Boston Red Sox, the New York Mets, the Texas Rangers, the Chicago Cubs and the Pittsburgh Pirates. Along with his Major League Baseball career, Pat also pitched two seasons in Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball in 1997 and 1998 for the Yokohama Bay Stars. Due to his baseball legacy, Pat is a member of the Sioux Falls Canaries Hall of Fame.</p><p>In the late ’90s, Pat married Randi Martin. The two divorced in 2006. The couple had two sons: Patrick born in 1995, and Jackson born in 2000. Jackson, Patrick’s younger brother, is also a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a> star with more than than 840,000 followers. In 2019, he posted a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">video</a> reminding his followers that he is indeed Patrick’s younger brother. “Yes Patrick Mahomes is my brother,” he wrote. Pat is also the dad to Patrick’s half-sister, Zoe Mahomes.</p><p>In an interview with CBS Sports in 2020, Patrick opened up about a conversation he had with his father after he signed a <a href=# rel=noopener>$500 million contract</a> with the Chiefs. “My dad texted me a couple days after the contract: ‘Do you feel any different,'” he recalled. “I said I feel exactly the same. I’m going to be the same person I was before I got the contract and before I got to the NFL—to be the best Patrick Mahomes I can be every single day.”</p><p>At a press conference in 2021, <a href=# rel=noopener>Patrick</a> also about the lessons he learned about parenthood from his own father and his sports career. “I got to see him battle and grind to try to get back there,” he said. “You never know if it’s going to be like this for the rest of your career. So I try to win as much as possible now and do whatever I can to win multiple Super Bowls.” He continued, “I’m at the right point in my career where I can use my voice and people can really, really make an impact in this world. This year, with everything that happened, it prompted me to really be bigger, and then be more than I had been before.”</p><p>In 2022, Patrick and his wife, Brittany Matthews welcomed their second child, a son named Patrick Lavone Mahomes III, after him and his father. (They welcomed their first child, a daughter named Sterling, in 2021.)</p><p>At a press conference in December 2022, Patrick explained why he wanted to name his son after him and his father, and how his brother, Jackson Mahomes, came up with his son’s nickname, Bronze.<span>“When me and Brittany, when we had Sterling, we didn’t know if it was a girl or boy at first. So we started thinking of girl and boy names. We wanted them to have that connection and them to be brother and sister forever,” he said.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve always wanted to do Patrick Lavon Mahomes III. I’ve thought about that since I was literally like five or six years old. I always thought it was going to be ‘Trey’ as the third — you hear of a lot of people doing that. My brother Jackson, whenever we were trying to find something that was a little unique and different, he said, “What about Bronze? It fits perfectly with Sterling.’ We went with that, and I think it works out well.”</span></p><p>On January 24, 2024, ahead of the Chiefs AFC Championship against the Baltimore Ravens, Pat revealed how he’d feel about sitting next to Taylor Swift, who we all know is dating Chiefs Tight End Travis Kelce. “I hope not,” he joked on WFAN Sports Radio’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>“Evan & Tiki”</a>. “Travis normally has his own thing and Patrick has his own deal too. … I imagine if Taylor wants her own suite, she’s got enough money to get whichever one she wants.”</p><p><a href=#>Patrick Mahomes’ dad</a> was arrested on a DWI charge on February 3, 2024, less than 10 days before his son played in the Super Bowl. It’s the third time Patrick Snr. has faced such a charge; he got his second DWI in 2018 and served 40 days in jail over weekends in 2019 and 2020. The bond for the latest offense was set at $10,000.</p><p>Patrick Jnr. was asked about the incident and gave short responses when pressed by reporters on the issue. “He’s doing good,” the quarterback said. “I don’t really want to get into it too much, but he’s doing good for whatever the situation is.” He declined to say anything else. “It’s a family matter,” he reiterated, “so I’ll just keep it to the family. And that’s all I really have to say at this point.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-patrick-mahomes-mother-randi-mahomes>Who is Patrick Mahomes’ mother, Randi Mahomes?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/randi-mahomes.png><p>Randi Mahomes (née Martin) is Patrick and Jackson’s mother. She is also the mom of his other half-sister, Mia Randall. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ABC4</a> in 2020, Randi opened up about what it was like raising Patrick and why she always knew he was going to be successful. “I knew when it came to sports he was going to be able to reach whatever level he wanted,” she said at the time. “Before his junior year in high school he came to me that summer wanting to quit football, but I just said you’re going to regret it if you quit.”</p><p>Randi also revealed that her son is quite different from what NFL fans may perceive him as. “He’s really a private person. He was always a good kid I will say,” she told ABC4. That said, she admitted that her son was also a bit of a troublemaker. “I had to ground him from practicing when he got in trouble as a kid,” she said. And Randi added that he never liked to be the center of attention,” she said. As for what football has done for her family, Randi had this to say, “I am proud of the football, but the family part of it—I’m way more proud and that’s something that I definitely don’t get enough of.”</p><p>In an interview with the <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Houston Chronicle</a> in 2020, Randi opened up about what it was like to be the wife of an MLB player. “People would say to me, ‘You don’t have to work, you must be so lucky! You have this house, this pool, it must be so great,’” she said. “But I remember deep inside, I was hurting.” She also told the newspaper why she wanted to raise her children in a spiritual home. “I tried to make sure every Sunday we were at church,” she said.</p><p>“If I can’t teach my kids, maybe they will hear something at church that will drive them in the right direction. I made sure God was our foundation.” She revealed that, when Patrick was in middle school, he was invited to a youth group at a church, where his son fell in love with his faith.&nbsp;“It’s kind of far from our house. [But] I will make it happen,” Randi said. “He had his hands up with his eyes closed, and I remember thinking, ‘My job’s done, he knows God, and as a mother I can see it.’”</p><p>She also told the Houston Chronicle about how, when she was 16 years old, she moved out of her parents’ house because of how they disapproved of her dating Patrick’s father. (Randi is white, while Pat is Black.) “I look back at it now as a parent,” she said. “I think it was to protect me and to protect my children from the meanness of the world. We were in a small town where no one dated outside their race.”</p><p>As for what it’s been like since Patrick competed in his first Super Bowl and became an NFL superstar, Randi confessed that her son’s rise in fame had been a transition. “It’s all been a learning curve for us — how to be a family in this new reality,” Randi said. She continued, “I have been proud of him. I think what I told him stuck with him. Thankfully, he’s very mature, very smart. Patrick’s out in this world, with the world at his fingertips. I remind him: God has gotten you here.”</p><p>Still, Randi doesn’t take credit for her children’s success. “Now people say I’m doing such a good job. I say, ‘I can only pray and leave it to God to handle the rest.’ And that’s how I’ve tried to raise my children. They will make mistakes, just like all of us,” she said.</p><p>In February 2023, she spoke to local news team KSHB 41, saying <a rel=nofollow href=#>how excited she was that her son</a> had made the Super Bowl again. “I remember telling Patrick, for the first year at the Super Bowl when we won, I said, ‘Look enjoy this moment, the guys worked their entire lives for it.’ I was having this mom pep talk and I was like, ‘Just take it, relax and joy and he was like, ‘No I’m going to be back and I’m like, ‘But most people don’t. He’s like, ‘Yeah but I’m gonna be back and, he was right about something. … It’s becoming a nice yearly tradition.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/super-bowl-book.jpeg><p>For more about the Super Bowl, football fans can check out <a data-pmc-sp-product=53d1db0529f18ff6311aa0fe97247319 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl","price":"24.87","id":"1589799208","category":"State & Local"},"id":1190809,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl</a> by Harvey Frommer. The best-selling book delves into the history of the first Super Bowl, which was originally known as the AFL-NFL Championship Game. (The term “Super Bowl” was coined only in its third year.) The debut game, between the winning Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, was played in front of only 61,946 people at&nbsp;the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum—an audience well&nbsp;below the stadium’s capacity. Harvey Frommer, a sports historian and reporter, puts the tale of that momentous game together using oral history, gathered by hundreds of interviews with players, coaches, media and spectators alike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/entertainment-newsletter-banner.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9kHJncWhpZL2iwNGimqRlnZa1sLnErGSpmaKau7W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./big-texas-dance-hall-closes-due-to-covid-19.html><span>←</span><span>Big Texas Dance Hall Closes Due To COVID-19</span></a>
