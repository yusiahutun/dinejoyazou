According to her birth date, Tana is 25 years old as of 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Tana-Mongeau-Age.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=tana-mongeau-s-parents><span id=Tana_Mongeaus_Parents><strong>Tana Mongeau’s Parents</strong></span></h3><p>Rick Mongeau and Rebecca Mongeau are her parents’ names, including her father and mother. Tana was born and raised by her parents in Las Vegas, Nevada. But, Tana has a troubled relationship with her parents, which was brought up on one of her Christmas specials on MTV’s Tana Turns 21 YouTube.</p><p>Tana Mongeau opened up about her rocky relationship with her parents in her holiday particular, not the first time she talked about her fragile relationship with her family.</p><p>Still, it was undoubtedly a low moment for the confident YouTuber. Mongeau declared she had no family and heartbreakingly admitted she was the relationship’s parent. Two parents were unsuitable to be her parents, and she still does not want them in her life in many respects. Growing up, family outings were always a shitty experience for her. Mongeau’s father was a swimming pool cleaner and a Vietnam War veteran when she was a kid, and her mother, who suffered from severe social anxiety, barely left the house when she was a child.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=tana-mongeau-s-boyfriend><span id=Tana_Mongeaus_Boyfriend><strong>Tana Mongeau’s Boyfriend</strong></span></h3><p>The social media star, being openly bisexual, has also been in a relationship with some men.

After just one month of dating, she was engaged to him, which was unbelievable to her fans and fellow YouTuber fans. She married him again after a month, on July 28, 2019, in Las Vegas in a ceremony that was also available for her fans to watch through pay-per-view for $50. Later, in 2020, she announced her breakup with him.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=tana-mongeau-cody-ko><span id=Tana_Mongeau_Cody_Ko><strong>Tana Mongeau Cody Ko</strong></span></h3><p>Fans are commenting about Tana Mongeau’s recent accusation on her podcast called Cancelled, where she claimed that she previously hooked up with Cody Ko, and some are unwilling to trust her. Twitter fans are startled by the social media star’s comment and, on the other hand, appear to have least anticipated anything to happen between her and Cody.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=tana-mongeau-merch><span id=Tana_Mongeau_Merch><strong>Tana Mongeau Merch</strong></span></h3><p>Tana Mongeau has made her merch with her hoodie, necklace, and other accessories, which her fans can order, buy and wear through her verified websites.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=tana-mongeau-s-net-worth><span id=Tana_Mongeaus_Net_Worth><strong>Tana Mongeau’s Net Worth</strong></span></h3><p>Tana’s net worth is projected to be around $4 million per celebrity net worth.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=tana-mongeau-twitter><span id=Tana_Mongeau_Twitter><strong>Tana Mongeau Twitter</strong></span></h3><p>Tana Mongeau is an active user of Twitter under the username @tanamongeau.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=tana-mongeau-instagram><span id=Tana_Mongeau_Instagram><strong>Tana Mongeau Instagram</strong></span></h3><p>Tana Mongeau is an active user of Instagram under the username @tanamongeau.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=trivia><span id=Trivia><strong>Trivia</strong></span></h3><ul><li>The social media star’s sexual orientation is bisexual, which she is open about.</li><li>In one of its episodes, she has also been featured on a tabloid talk show named Maury.</li><li>Tana was in a relationship with Bella Throne in a throuple with Mod Sun.</li><li>She debuted a single named Hefner in 2017, which included her ex-girlfriend, Bella Throne.</li><li>Mongeau has hosted TanaCon, including many celebrities, in her convention.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></span></h3><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Tana Mongeau?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tana Mongeau is an internet personality, model, and YouTuber known for her vlogs, storytimes, and collaborations with other influencers.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>When was Tana Mongeau born?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tana Mongeau was born on June 24, 1998.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Where is Tana Mongeau from?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tana Mongeau is from Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>What is Tana Mongeau known for?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tana Mongeau is popularly known for her videos uploaded on her YouTube channel.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>Is Tana Mongeau cancelled?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tana Mongeau has launched her podcast named “CANCELLED!”.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>Why is Tana Mongeau demonetized?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tana Mongeau was demonetized because of the copyright issue.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>Is Tana Mongeau A Millionaire?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tana Mongeau has an estimated net worth of $4 million.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>How old is tana mongeau?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tana Mongeau is 25 years old.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>Who is tana mongeau dating?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tana Mongeau is currently in a relationship with rapper Lil Xan.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>Who is tana mongeau manager?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>The name of Tana Mongeau’s manager is David Weintraub.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>What is Tana Mongeau known for on YouTube?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tana Mongeau gained popularity on YouTube for her storytime videos, vlogs, and collaborations with other YouTubers.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>What controversies have Tana Mongeau been involved in?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tana Mongeau has been involved in several controversies throughout her career, including disputes related to her relationship with Jake Paul and issues surrounding her “TanaCon” convention in 2018.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Has Tana Mongeau released any music?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Yes, Tana Mongeau has released music.
