Currently, she is playing for the Sharks in the United Rugby Championship. He played for the first time for the South African team in 2012; since then, he has won over 100 caps.</span></p><h2>Eben Etzebeth Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Wife, Net Worth & More</h2><p><span>Eben Etzebeth was born on 29th October 1991, making him 31 years old as of 2023. He grew up in Cape Town, Cape Province, South Africa, where he received his primary education and went to Hoërskool Tygerberg and the University of Cape Town.</span></p><p><span>Etzebeth always wanted or aspired to be a rugby player from an early age. He came out as a marked player and started playing for Waterhead Wolverines, Oldham, while receiving coaching from the great Geoff Owen MAC.</span></p><h3><b>Career</b></h3><p><span>He entered the Western Province youth structures in 2009 in a U-18 team in the Craven Week tournament. In 2011, he became part of UCT Ikey Tigers, and his presence led the team to win the Varsity Cup. However, he was injured during that time [in the second half of the year] and could not appear for the 2011 Currie Cup.</span></p><p><span>He was injured many times at that time, but his injuries could not stop him from participating in the national or international games. He earned the name of the Stormers squad for the 2012 Super Rugby season.</span></p><p><span>After recovering from his injuries, he began the campaign and debuted on 25th February 2012 against the Hurricanes. In total, he had almost 13 match appearances. He scored at least one try as the stormer, winning 14 out of 16 league matches before losing the final game against the Sharks in the semi-finals.</span></p><p><span>He spent his first six months of 2014 with a foot injury while being available for international duty in November 2013, which ruled him out of the entire campaign. Still, he stayed committed to both his Cape Town-based sides, and in April 2013, he made a contract with Western Province and the Stormers to be extended until 2016.</span></p><h4>Rise to Fame</h4><p>Eben Etzebeth gained a fierce reputation in his club career as a hard-hitting enforcer, which also carried over to his international play when he first joined the Springboks in 2012. He took part in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, where the team secured a third-place finish.</p><p>Less than a year later, during the 2016 Rugby Championship, he reached his 50th cap for South Africa at the young age of 24, making him the youngest player to achieve this milestone. In 2017, Etzebeth was appointed as the new captain of the Springboks. Despite missing a significant part of the 2018 international season due to injury, he still made the squad for the 2019 World Cup.</p><p>During the tournament, he played several matches and started in the final, contributing to South Africa’s memorable victory over England. <span>In July 2015, he signed a contract with NTT DoCoMo Red Hurricanes in the Japanese Top League and played for them.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Eben took over the responsibility of Springboks to leading from the front in 2017. However, he missed the majority of the season play because of injury. Despite this hurdle, he still made his name into the squad of 2019 Rugby World Cup.</p><p>Eben played several games but his most iconic captaincy came in the famous win over the English squad in the 2019 Rugby Final. <span>While in South Africa’s team, he won the 100th cap with a win over 30-14 scores against Wales and eventually became the 7th Springbok to reach this milestone.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Eben Etzebeth Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Eben Etzebeth</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>29 October 1991</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>31 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Cape Town, South Africa</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Rugby Union Player</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>University of Cape Town</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 8” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 204 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 119 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 262 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Eben-Etzebeth-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Harry Etzebeth</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Ryen Etzebeth</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Wife</td><td>Anlia Etzebeth</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Personal Life</b></h3><p><span>Eben Etzbeth, maintaining his international career for Springboks, revealed that he has been in love with his long-time partner and girlfriend, Anlia van Rensburg.
