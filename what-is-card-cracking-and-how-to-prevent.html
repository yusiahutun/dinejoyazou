Usually, attackers <a href=#>target victims by social engineering</a> through email, social media, text messages, or phone calls. These attackers can be very convincing and will make their victims believe that they are legitimate.</p><p>The attacker uses the debit card or bank information to deposit a phony check and instantly withdraw that money, leaving a small portion for the victim too.</p><p>However, since the check is stolen or fake, it is later on returned against the victim's account, which creates a negative balance, and the victim becomes a criminal accomplice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/how-virtual-cards-work-1.jpg><p>To clearly understand this, here's an example. Suppose someone calls or texts you and tell you that they have a $10,000 check that they urgently need to cash out, but they don't have a bank account to deposit that check. So they cleverly frame a fake scenario and ask for your help to make the deposit in your bank account. In return, they promise to leave a certain amount, say, $1500, in your account.</p><p>In the hope of helping someone in need (and earning $1500!), you might give them your card details to make the deposit. However, what you don't know is that they will withdraw all the amount of the deposited check and leave a negative balance in your account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-is-card-cracking-conducted>How Is Card Cracking Conducted</h2><p>Card cracking is conducted by skilled scammers who plan everything in advance to conduct the scam successfully. Here are the general steps they take.</p><h3 id=step-1-steal-or-create-a-phony-check>Step 1: Steal or Create a Phony Check</h3><p>First, the criminal steals a check or creates a phony check using digital forgery techniques. This check is used as a base for the scam.</p><h3 id=step-2-lure-victims-to-get-their-card-details>Step 2: Lure Victims to Get Their Card Details<img alt="Attacker looking at card details" height=685 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Phishing-Attack.jpg width=1280 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The attacker will then lure victims by offering them a money-making opportunity in exchange for their card details. To lure in victims, they use online platforms <a href=#>such as social media</a>, emails, texts, or phone calls to explain their urgent financial situation. They also promise some money in return for making it look like a genuine opportunity. The victim then provides their debit card or banking details in exchange for the offer.</p><h3 id=step-3-deposit-phony-check-into-victim-39-s-account>Step 3: Deposit Phony Check into Victim's Account</h3><p>The attacker deposits the phony check into the victim's account, and once it appears in their statement, they instantly attempt to withdraw that money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=step-4-withdraw-funds-from-victim-39-s-account>Step 4: Withdraw Funds from Victim's Account</h3><p>Next, the attacker will withdraw all the funds from the victim's account. Sometimes, they will leave a small portion of it for the victim, making it look like a legitimate deal.</p><h3 id=step-5-check-is-returned-against-the-victim-39-s-account>Step 5: Check Is Returned Against the Victim's Account<img alt="close up shot of payment check on top of envelope" height=937 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/check-envelope-1.jpg width=1920 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Since the deposited check is fake or stolen, it will eventually be returned to the victim's account. This creates a negative balance in their accounts and makes them liable to pay back that amount with penalties.</p><h3 id=step-6-victim-becomes-a-criminal-accomplice>Step 6: Victim Becomes a Criminal Accomplice</h3><p>The victim is now stuck with a negative balance in their account, and the criminal has successfully transferred the funds to a different account. The victim is also liable for legal action if found guilty of being a party to criminal activity.</p><h2 id=who-are-the-common-targets-of-scammers>Who Are the Common Targets of Scammers?</h2><p>Card cracking targets innocent victims who do not have the necessary knowledge to differentiate between genuine and fake activities.
