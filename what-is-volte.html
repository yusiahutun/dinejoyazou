As the name suggests, VoLTE is a voice call made over a 4G LTE network. You can place a call via your LTE network instead of using the "standard" network.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But what are the benefits of using VoLTE? Does it have any downsides, and how can you turn it on or off on your phone?</p><h2 id=what-is-volte>What Is VoLTE?</h2><p>VoLTE is a wireless communication protocol used for making voice calls. Known for its impressively high speeds, VoLTE is used by billions of people worldwide to make voice-based calls through their 4G cellular network. VoLTE also offers more coverage and faster data transfers than 2G and 3G networks.</p><p>Your phone has likely come with VoLTE enabled, though you can turn it off (which we'll discuss later). While all newer iPhones offer VoLTE, there are some exceptions when it comes to Android phones, as so many different brands use Android.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While making a VoLTE call, you can use your data for calling and browsing at the same time. VoLTE has turned out to be one of the finest features to improve voice calls worldwide.</p><p>Many modern smartphones now support VoLTE, and many network operators offer VoLTE support worldwide. If your phone doesn't support VoLTE, you can either upgrade to a VoLTE-capable smartphone or wait for a potential software update that might enable this feature.</p><p>If you're unsure whether your phone offers VoLTE, it's best to head to your settings and check.</p><h2 id=5-benefits-of-using-volte>5 Benefits of Using VoLTE</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/VoLTE-benifits.jpeg><p>There are several perks that come with using VoLTE on your phone. Let's discuss them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=high-definition-call-quality>1. High Definition Call Quality</h3><p>The most significant advantage of 4G VoLTE is the improved call quality. VoLTE facilitates clearer communication over voice calls.</p><p>While the call quality of previous network generations, such as 2G and 3G, was not high-definition, 4G VoLTE delivers three times better call quality than 3G and up to six times that of 2G.</p><h3 id=good-battery-life>2. Good Battery Life</h3><p>Without VoLTE, you might notice your 4G network switching to 3G during calls, which drains the smartphone battery more quickly. With VoLTE, your phone doesn't switch to 3G even if you are on call, saving battery life.</p><h3 id=more-coverage-and-better-connectivity>3. More Coverage and Better Connectivity</h3><p>You will be surprised to know that VoLTE calls can connect up to twice as fast as 2G or 3G signals. Plus, 4G is widely available all over the world now.</p><p>Some 4G networks operate on an 800 MHz spectrum, which can provide broader coverage compared to the 2G or 3G spectrum. This spectrum can even penetrate massive objects, which previous generations struggled to do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, even if you are in the basement or on the top floor, you will have a network connection. Therefore, even though VoLTE depends on this spectrum to provide better coverage and better connectivity, the available network is wider and more consistent.</p><h3 id=multitasking>4. Multitasking</h3><p>Without VoLTE, your 4G network becomes 3G on calls, restricting you from using fast internet during calls. With 4G VoLTE, this doesn't happen.</p><p>Your 4G network remains the same, allowing you to use your data between calls. You can browse the web, download media, and more during VoLTE calls.</p><h3 id=video-calls-over-volte>5. Video Calls Over VoLTE</h3><p>You can even make video calls over VoLTE with very little data consumption. Usually, you have to download third-party apps like Skype, Google Meet, Zoom, etc., for video calls.</p><p>But with 4G VoLTE, you don't need to install any other applications. 4G VoLTE compatible phones support video calls built into their calling system. Furthermore, 4G VoLTE saves battery on video calls. That said, if you want to video chat with your friends or colleagues, we have a list of the <a href=#>best free group video chat apps you can use</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-limitations-of-volte-services>3 Limitations of VoLTE Services</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/messaging-image.jpg><p>While VoLTE brings tons of benefits to mobile phone service, there are also some drawbacks associated with this technology. Here are some of the limitations and challenges associated with VoLTE services.</p><h3 id=hd-calls-limitations>1. HD Calls Limitations</h3><p>While VoLTE calls provide high-definition calls, this feature is limited to calls between two VoLTE-enabled handsets. If one handset is VoLTE-enabled and the other is not, then the call will be of standard quality and not HD.</p><h3 id=requires-internet>2. Requires Internet</h3><p>VoLTE calls need either a data connection or a 4G signal to work. If not, you will not be able to make HD calls or use the internet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=handset-support-needed>3. Handset Support Needed</h3><p>Your device must be compatible to enable VoLTE services. Many users do not have VoLTE services enabled on their smartphones. While some smartphones receive the service with an update, many older models are incompatible with VoLTE.</p><h2 id=how-to-turn-volte-on-or-off-on-your-smartphone>How to Turn VoLTE On or Off on Your Smartphone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/VoLTE-icon.jpg><p>Turning VoLTE on and off on your smartphone is a simple process and does not require anything more than your smartphone. The only requirement is that your phone should support 4G VoLTE. Telecom and smartphone companies sometimes refer to VoLTE calls as <strong>HD calls</strong>. So, if your phone has an <strong>HD call</strong> option, you should keep that in mind.</p><p>The VoLTE1 icon on your smartphone means VoLTE (Voice over LTE) calling is active for SIM 1.

Multiple smartphones and telecom companies provide VoLTE features through software updates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With several carriers discontinuing 3G services, users have no choice but to switch to VoLTE. So, if you are looking for better connectivity and call performance, then upgrading to a VoLTE-enabled smartphone is a good move. You can even use these <a href=#>apps to make or receive free domestic and international calls over Wi-Fi or cellular</a>.</p><p>As we progress into a more digitally integrated future, the role of VoLTE is set to become even more significant. As 5G continues to develop, VoLTE is expected to continue to dominate voice communication. 5G networks rely on the same core network technology as 4G LTE, which makes VoLTE a natural fit for voice services.</p><h2 id=volte-has-its-perks-and-drawbacks>VoLTE Has Its Perks and Drawbacks</h2><p>Global VoLTE adoption continues to rise. However, it's important to consider potential data charges when making calls using data connections. These calls eat into your allowance, using them faster than you might expect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, many network providers are shifting to Wi-Fi Calling, which works on Wi-Fi rather than data networks. At a time when mass 5G uptake is around the corner, you may see new technologies replacing VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling services.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edWoo62dXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./union-square-cafes-bar-nuts.html><span>←</span><span>union square cafes barnuts</span></a>
