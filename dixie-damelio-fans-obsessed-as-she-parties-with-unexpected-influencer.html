The star-studded party took place in the Hamptons to celebrate Independence Day. Celebrities and influencers across the country gathered in one place, for what we can only imagine was the most eventful party of the decade.</strong></p><p>The D’Amelio’s rose to fame in 2019 when Charli blew up on <a href=#>TikTok</a>. <a href=#>Dixie D’Amelio</a> also gained tons of followers, leading to the whole family starring in a reality show for Hulu in 2021. Now, the family mingles with mainstream <a href=#>celebrity</a> stars, as the influencer world carries on growing.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/07/GettyImages-1497237040-698x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alix-earle-and-dixie-d-amelio-attend-michael-rubin-s-white-party>Alix Earle and Dixie D’Amelio attend Michael Rubin’s white party</h2><p>It looked like the party of all parties this Independence Day, as Michael Rubin hosted a star-studded white party in the Hamptons, attended by TikTok superstars, Dixie D’Amelio and <a href=#>Alix Earle</a>.</p><p>Alix Earle is a 22-year-old University of Miami grad, who recently became one of the fastest-growing creators on the app. At the time of writing, she has 5.5 million followers on the platform, with her relatable personality and GRWM videos helping her to grow such a following.</p><p>After the bash, both Dixie and influencer Alix Earle posted photos with one another over on their respective pages. Dixie opted for a short cut-out dress with knee-high boots. Alix on the other hand, stunned in a mesh dress.</p><p>D’Amelio also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> pictures alongside Michael, who included a pic with Dixie, <a href=#>Charli D’Amelio</a>, and Marc on his own grid.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans in awe at the ‘unexpected duo’</h2><p>Of course, like any ‘celeb link up’ fans took to the comments to express how shocked they were that the two were together.</p><p>“Alix and Dixie???” questioned one shocked fan.</p><p>“Crossover episode,” joked another.</p><p>“Most unexpected duo,” wrote another. However, one fan responded: “They’ve hung out before a few times!!! They are pretty good friends.”</p><p>The two continued to confirm this on their Instagram stories as they captioned the posts: “engagement photos.”</p><p>“You girls slayed the house down with those boots,” penned one fan.</p><p>One simply commented: “Obsessed.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who else was in attendance?</h2><p>Arguably the most celeb-filled party of the year, we’d be here all day if we listed every A-Lister in attendance. However, some noticeable attendees aside from Dixie and Alix were Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, and <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>.</p><p>Ne-Yo and <a href=#>Usher</a> took to the stage to perform at the $50 million mansion, with Kevin Haart being pulled up to celebrate his birthday early, with falls on July 6.</p><p>Our invites must have gotten lost in the post.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlvX2WCcLDIsaCeZZSWuqa4yKhkn5meqHqwrtKeqqydlGKutHnSoZxmqJGnwaqx0mauoqyYYsKvsdepnJyslZl6qrrFpayeppOav3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aron-piper.html><span>←</span><span>Aron Piper</span></a>
