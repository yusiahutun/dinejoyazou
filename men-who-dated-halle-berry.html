Regarded as one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation, Berry first rose to prominence as a model.</p><p>As a teenager, Berry reached the final in national beauty pageants. Afterward, she began working as a model before transitioning into movies. Berry started acting on television in 1989.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/59/1b/22/591b22b26b555fe5c3c65cba3e968716.jpg><p>She starred in the movie “Jungle Fever” in 1989 and then in “Boomerang” alongside Eddie Murphy. Berry started getting noticed due to her roles in the movies, and in 1995 she starred in the film “Losing Isiah.”</p><p>Berry’s big break in the movie industry came in 1999 when she portrayed film star Dorothy Dandridge in the television film “Introducing Dorothy Dandridge.” her performance earned her Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.&nbsp;</p><p>She also became the first African-American nominated for an Oscar award in the best actress category. In 2001 Berry became the first African American to win the Academy Award for best actress.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>earned </a>the award for her brilliant performance as Leticia Musgrove in the film “Monster’s Ball.” The actress has since starred in a lot of top-rated movies, including “X-Men,” “Swordfish,” “Die Another Day,” “Catwoman,” and “Kingsman: The Golden Circle.”&nbsp;</p><p>Away from the screen, the actress has managed to keep her private life mainly away from the media. The beautiful actress is also one of the famous people <a href=#>living </a>frugal lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to her stunning looks, Berry’s romantic life has always interested her fans. So below, we’ll look at the lucky men who dated Halle Berry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Danny_Wood></span><strong>Danny Wood&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, Berry dated “New Kids On The Block” member Danny Wood. At the time, Berry was still an upcoming actress in the industry. Nevertheless, she and Wood were pictured acting loved up multiple times by the media.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/88/45/2b/88452b15fea6ecdaf1eb4aa23b5055f3.jpg><p>Unfortunately, it looked like their romance only lasted for a couple of months. Still, at that time, they looked like the perfect couple. Wood is the first popular guy who dated Halle Berry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Christopher_Williams></span><strong>Christopher Williams</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During the early ‘90s, Berry dated R&B singer Christopher Williams. The two were seemingly very much in love with one another and had a serious relationship. However, after almost one year of dating, the pair ended their romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/85/73/62/85736244d2a3f3afaf569e57bcdbccf0.jpg><p>After their separation, rumors swirled that someone Berry was dating had physically hurt her. The actress also reportedly lost some hearing in her ear. Years later, in 2004, Williams refuted reports that suggested he was the one who had hurt Berry.</p><p>The singer declared that the media’s words about him and Berry were false. He then accused actor Wesley Snipes as the culprit who busted Berry’s ears. However, Berry has not named her abuser or confirmed Williams’ words.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=David_Justice></span><strong>David Justice</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After dating for a while, Berry married baseball player David Justice in 1993. Justice, who has <a href=#>played </a>for the Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians, became Berry’s first husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/ae/31/d0/ae31d0bdd9cb5fc77eb33ee431657718.jpg><p>Although the pair looked like the perfect couple during the early stages of their marriage, it didn’t last. Sadly, after four years of marriage, they divorced in 1997. At the time, rumors swirled that Justice abused Berry during their marriage.</p><p>However, the player who has won two World Series pennants defended himself, saying he never hit the actress.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Shemar_Moore></span><strong>Shemar Moore</strong>&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After her relationship with Justice ended, Berry dated actor Shemar Moore. The two Tv stars fell in love with each other, and Moore even disclosed he fell hard for Berry. But, according to him, the pair had to keep their relationship secretive to avoid massive media attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/45/39/1d/45391def93b3c450e92675f131c9dc14.jpg><p>Unfortunately, their romance didn’t turn into anything serious. They separated after dating for just a couple of months. Speaking on their fling, Shemar admitted he was smitten with Berry because they had much in common.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Eric_Benet></span><strong>Eric Benet</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2001 Berry got married for the second time to R&B singer Eric Benet. A year after tying the knot, Benet attended the Oscar ceremony where Berry won her maiden award. After the ceremony, the two posed on the red carpet and even kissed to the photographers’ delight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/ec/94/36/ec9436adff4261ddc606eac13a88eec4.jpg><p>Sadly, just like her first marriage, Berry’s relationship with Benet didn’t last long either. The couple divorced in 2005 after the singer admitted to cheating on Berry. Speaking to Oprah Winfrey after their divorce, Berry admitted that Benet’s affair broke her heart.</p><p>The actress disclosed her ex-husband’s affairs led her to an emotional breakdown. Berry also revealed she knew it was not her fault that Benet decided to cheat. They finalized their divorce in 2005.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Michael_Ealy></span><strong>Michael Ealy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Berry and “Think Like A Man” star Michael Ealy <a href=#>dated </a>in 2004. The pair met when they co-starred in the movie “Their Eyes Were Watching God.” Although they had a deep relationship, it lasted very shortly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/23/18/72/231872cf73ca8ae390232696d5422295.jpg><p>The two separated on good terms, and they remained friends afterward. But, according to Berry, she broke things off with Ealy because she felt it would be okay to be on her own.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Gabriel_Aubry></span><strong>Gabriel Aubry</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Months after her romance with Ealy ended, Berry started a relationship with Canadian model Gabriel Aubry. The pair had met at a Versace photoshoot. In March 2008, Berry gave birth to their daughter Nahla Ariela Aubry. Although they weren’t married, the two remained committed to each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/bc/1a/c1/bc1ac1c46543f77e7bbba21628bf4cf0.jpg><p>However, two years after the birth of their child, Berry and Aubry separated. They also took each other to court over the custody of their child. It took till 2014 before they reached an amicable agreement with Berry paying him $16,000 in child support. Aubry became the only one who dated Halle Berry that long without marrying her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Olivier_Martinez></span><strong>Olivier Martinez</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After splitting from Aubry, Berry started dating French-born actor Olivier Martinez.
