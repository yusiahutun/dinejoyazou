However, she had lingering feelings for Cinco Holland Jr., who moved on from her to Trina Njoroge.</p><p id=par-3_23>Eventually, Cash worked through her complicated emotions and wanted to continue with “Prince Charlie,” but he admitted he didn’t feel the same anymore.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_28>On Day 26, Alana Paolucci arrived and quickly got Charlie’s attention. The two developed a connection, and he found himself pulling away toward Cash and in her direction.</p><p id=par-5_22>After battling his feelings for a couple of days, Charlie shocked the villa by dumping the fan-favorite from the island, choosing Alana.</p><h2><strong>They announced breakup one month after the finale; she says ‘pressure’ played a role</strong></h2><p id=par-6_29>Regardless of how they connected, the couple seemed to have genuine feelings for each other, and their families expressed their approval when they phoned in near the season’s finale.</p><p id=par-7_45>Mainly because fans could watch other connections develop, and the newer couple didn’t receive much screen time, they placed fourth. After the conclusion, Charlie did an interview with Pop Culture where he admitted he contemplated what would have happened had he <a href=#>chosen Cash over Alana.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Since the moment she walked into the Villa, Alana has been such a thrill-a.

She&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly ended things</a>&nbsp;for good due to his alleged habit of frequently partying. Charlie also apparently revealed that he missed Cashay and admitted he wished to continue exploring their connection.</p><p id=par-9_28>Four months after the split, Alana explained the relationship didn’t work out because it got “too messy” on her Instagram story. Additionally, she admitted&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“too much pressure”</a>&nbsp;played a role.</p><h2><strong>All of the ‘Love Island USA’ season 3 finalists have split up</strong></h2><p id=par-10_30>Third-place finishers <a href=#>Jeremy Hershberg and Bailey Marshall</a> were the first to break up. In a Sept. 2021 Instagram story, she explained they split due to his feelings for another person.</p><p id=par-11_35>A week later, he and Florita Diaz, who he coupled up with on the show, attempted a relationship. However, the long-distance fling lasted around a month before they decided they were better off as friends.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4><p lang=en dir=ltr>Charlie has no problem stirring the pot, but when it comes to speaking he won't say a lot.

They called it quits around Dec. 2021, following Will’s questionable behavior with other females on social media. Finally, winners Olivia Kaiser and Korey Gandy unofficially dated for around three months.</p><p id=par-13_37>According to Olivia, he hooked up with Florita during a Miami vacation and lied about it. She claims she has since forgiven him and maintains the two are still in frequent communication.&nbsp;Love Island USA&nbsp;is streaming on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS5sMLEZqCspJGjsW7B0ppkmqSRo65uvMCoo66bk556sb7ErKquqpViwLG4yK1kn6qfonqktMCro6KdXaHGr6%2FHZ5%2BtpZxk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natural-remedies-for-summer-dandruff.html><span>←</span><span>3 Natural Remedies for Nixing Summer Dandruff</span></a>
