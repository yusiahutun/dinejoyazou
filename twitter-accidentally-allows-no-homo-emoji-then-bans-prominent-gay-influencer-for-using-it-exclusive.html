Twitter accidentally allowed the creation of a &#34;No Homo&#34; emoji this week — and then banned a prominent gay Twitter user for using it.
Jovan Hill was one of the hundreds of perplexed/angry/bemused/ people who discovered this week that Twitter users had access to a new emoji: the pride flag with a &#34;no entry&#34; symbol over it.

We consider abusive behavior an attempt to harass, intimidate, or silence someone else's voice," Twitter told him, somewhat ironically.</p><p>"It's been awful, my entire income and online brand is via Twitter," Jovan told <a href=#><strong>TooFab</strong></a> exclusively on Wednesday. "I couldn't believe a gay guy using an emoji could have his account terminated while Nazis run rampant."</p><p>"It's ridiculous but barely shocking, feels like Twitter just finding an excuse to silence specific users again over any comment they can. It didn't even come with a warning or what tweet triggered my suspension."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f24fa48c-3981-59a9-8427-f5beec80ad94 data-container-ref=toofab:article:93059906-6a64-5cea-b110-093d1a82745c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ee/5by4/2019/02/19/eea9102c50ce5d8d8d9d0a48645bec12_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jussie Smollett's Siblings Jump to His Defense on Instagram Quoting Malcolm X and Blaming Media</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I lost about 120k followers and I think what bugs me most is its not like Twitter staff don't know I exist? I've had about 20 articles written about me now," he said.</p><p>"I'm not attempting to talk about myself just can't believe the Twitter bots seem to be anti-gay and anti-black at this point because Nazis get away with literal death threats despite staff's best alleged efforts."</p><p>He points out that despite his account previously hitting all the criteria, he still hasn't been able to get that invaluable "verified" tick: "I'm convinced it's something deeper at this point as a dog-petting account was verified yesterday despite... no press."</p><p>The 25-year-old revealed he had been banned in the past in frustratingly similar circumstances: for tweeting the word "f--". "They really have a shitty system," he said.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d3cc9d64-2f81-5df8-be1a-09d898688549 data-container-ref=toofab:article:93059906-6a64-5cea-b110-093d1a82745c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ae/5by4/2018/12/03/ae4c4f53e0755805a788e69524a66872_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Tumblr</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tumblr Just Banned This and Users Are Freaking Out</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Jovan's is one of the most hilarious success stories of the digital influencer age. The college drop-out pays for his Brooklyn apartment — and his considerable weed habit — by simply asking fans to pay for it. And they happily do.</p><p>His modus operandi inspired a <a href=#><strong>New York Times</strong></a> article entitled "Live-Streaming Your Broke Self for Rent Money", as well as some less-flattering headlines like "Millennials Are Paying Thousands To This 'Digital Beggar,' An Unemployed Pot Fiend".</p><p>The Twitter user who first discovered the anomaly — whose Twitter handle is now "Mitchell (discovered [No Homo emoji])" — told <a href=#><strong>Out </strong></a>magazine he was initially shocked, but was happy to see people use it ironically or humorously.</p><p>"I've been embracing it, but it's also dangerous for people to use it hatefully," he added.</p><p><a href=#><strong>TooFab</strong></a> has reached out to Twitter for comment; while the creation of the emoji appeared to be a glitch, Emojipedia founder Jeremy Burge insisted on Twitter that it wasn't, and that the "no entry" emoji could be combined with any other, not just the pride flag.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnp7j2tma2hfqcSqwNOeqWaZk5i2pbHNrZilpKlirq24zrCqZqafYrWwuc5mnKanmp56tbTEp2SbmZ6oerG%2Bzqagp52eqXqordhmoKeenKqyr6%2FEq2Sfp6JiwrS1zaBkoqxdmsWkuNSsoK%2BdXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prosecutors-fight-sentence-reduction-murder-convict-html.html><span>←</span><span>Drug dealer jailed for role in death of 8yo murder trial witness, boy's mom could be free next year</span></a>
