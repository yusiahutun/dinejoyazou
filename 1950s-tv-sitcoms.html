While it had great on screen talent with Caesar and Coca, check out this writing staff: Carl Reiner (creator of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dick Van Dyke Show</a>), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mel Brooks</a>, Neil Simon (playwright and creator of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Odd Couple</a>), Larry Gelbert (co-creator of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">M*A*S*H</a>ˆ) and Woody Allen.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>YouTube (seek and ye shall find)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2.

Burns would frequently break the fourth wall and talk to the audience. Another cast member was Bea Benaderet, who would later voice Betty Rubble on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Flintstones </a>and play Kate Bradley on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Petticoat Junction</a>.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Tubi, Pure Flix and Classic, Antenna TV</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3.

Just to point out how big a star he was, there were 931 radio episodes between 1932 and 1955 and 260 television episodes over the course of 15 seasons. Through it all, Benny portrayed his ultra-cheap king of all media dealing with the people around him who were driving him nuts (though he oftentimes returned the favor).</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Tubi, Pure Flix, Antenna TV</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4.

I Love Lucy remains the most enduring situation comedy in television history — everything about it is brilliant, and the cast plays off of each other beautifully. As Lucille Ball herself would say, she wasn’t a comedian but she knew how to play comedy, which she proved on a weekly basis. The Ricardos and the Mertzes will long live on, and for good reason.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Paramount+, Paramount TV, Pluto TV</p><p><strong>MUST READ:</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Behind-the-Scenes Secrets of the 10 Funniest I Love Lucy Episodes</a></p><p><a href=#>William Frawley: 15 Facts About the Beloved I Love Lucy and My Three Sons Star</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6.

There would be comedy and musical guest stars each week.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>freevee, Roku, Tubi, Shout TV</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7.

The guys are unemployed entertainers constantly looking for a way to make a buck, Sidney Fields was their landlord and there were additional supporting characters as well.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>fubo, Peacock, Peacock Premium, Roku, Vudu, Pluto TV, freevee, Tubi</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9.

They did have a next door neighbor in the form of&nbsp;Don DeFore‘s Thorny. Yet another show spawned from a radio series. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet </a>spanned 14 seasons and 435 episodes.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>The Roku Channel, Vudu, Xumo, Tubi, Plex, Pluto TV, freevee,Peacock, Peacock Premium</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11.

She is the wife of judge Bradley Stevens (Jim Backus, Mr. Howell from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gilligan’s Island</a> and the voice of Mr. Magoo). Week to week , things don’t go so smoothly in the Stevens household.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Prime Video</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>13.

In a typical scene, Peepers sees a hopscotch grid chalked on a sidewalk and, thinking himself alone, plays the game with abandon, only to discover that his girlfriend Nancy has been silently watching the entire time.”</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Tubi</p><p><strong>MUST READ: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Randall, Much More Than One Half of The Odd Couple</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>15.

The show consists of monologues, comic sketches and dance numbers. Because of low ratings, it was turned into a sitcom midway through its run and became a show within a show, with Rex playing himself as a TV comic.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Not currently available</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>16. Make Room for Daddy (1953 to 1965)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/GettyImages-526895742.jpg><p><strong>CAST: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Danny Thomas</a>, Jean Hagen, Marjorie Lord, Rusty Hammer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Angela Cartwright</a></p><p><strong>THE SHOW:</strong> On this example of 1950s TV sitcoms, Danny Thomas&nbsp;portrays Danny Williams, a successful nightclub singer, who has to deal with funny — and oftentimes challenging — situations in his career and with his family. Lots of great supporting characters in what is yet another terrific example of a show that deserves to be called a classic. It should be noted that Thomas is father to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">That Girl </a>star&nbsp;Marlo Thomas.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Tubi, The Roku Channel, Pluto TV, freevee, Xuma, Plex</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>17.

In it, he played Raymond Wallace, a song-and-dance man who, through the comic misadventures in his life, is never on time for his performances.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Not currently available</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>18.

The Larry Storch Show was a summer replacement series for&nbsp;The Jackie Gleason Show. Along with his guests, he played a number of different characters.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Not currently available</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>19. The Life of Riley (1953 to 1958)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/GettyImages-514959650.jpg><p><strong>CAST: </strong><a href=#>William Bendix</a>, John Brown, Grace Coppin, Paula Winslowe</p><p><strong>THE SHOW:</strong> Tis another television show derived from a radio series that preceded it, and in this one William Bendix reprises the lead role. Chester A. Riley is a malaprop-ridden worker at a California aircraft plant, though the focus is heavily on his home life and various zany situations. He’s best known for the expression, “What a revoltin’ development this is!’ An earlier version of the series actually starred Jackie Gleason in his pre-Ralph Kramden days.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Not currently available</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>20. Life with Elizabeth (1953 to 1955)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/GettyImages-514959560.jpg><p><strong>CAST: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Betty White</a>, George Tibbles, Don Fedderson</p><p><strong>THE SHOW:</strong> Betty White — you know the Betty White we’re talking about — stars in the title role. She along with husband Alvin are pretty much your average suburban couple, but she tends to get them into various predicaments. Notes Wikipedia, “In the end, Alvin, in variable degrees of frustration, would say, ‘I shall leave you at this point, Elizabeth,’ and would walk out of sight. The announcer would say, ‘Elizabeth, aren’t you ashamed?’ She would slowly nod, but then, with a slightly devilish grin, would vigorously shake her head to indicate she wasn’t.” Described as “incidents,” each episode would be divided into three shorts.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Tubi, Pluto TV, Plex, freevee</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>21. My Favorite Husband (1953 to 1955)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/GettyImages-1389989177.jpg><p><strong>CAST: </strong>Joan Caulfield, Barry Nelson</p><p><strong>THE SHOW:</strong> Based on the Lucille Ball radio show that, itself, was turned into&nbsp;I Love Lucy. That’s why the TV version feels like there are many similarities, with&nbsp;Joan Caulfield&nbsp;as the wacky Liz Cooper, who is married to&nbsp;Barry Nelson‘s George Cooper, a bank executive. Their best friends are an older couple&nbsp;not&nbsp;named the Mertzes. The show was successful in its own right. Interesting trivia note: Nelson was the first actor to ever play James Bond; it was on a CBS live TV version of Casino Royale as part of Climax Theater.</p><p><strong>WHERE IT’S STREAMING/AIRING: </strong>Not currently available</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>22.
