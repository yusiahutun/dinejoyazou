The concept of a “sleep divorce” has been suggested as a means to sidestep conflicts and fortify the bond between partners.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Individuals often have divergent sleep preferences, including bedtime and wake-up times, room temperature, and mattress firmness. These variations can disrupt one partner’s sleep, potentially leading to irritability and interpersonal discord. There is also, of course, the issue of snoring.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sleeping separately allows each partner to tailor their sleep environment to suit their unique needs, thereby promoting optimal rest, improved sleep quality and enhanced mood, ultimately contributing to a healthier relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/11/57d22f8b-527f-48bb-a4cf-3f3212646b8d_b6760e77.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Recognising the pivotal role of quality sleep in fostering emotional and physical intimacy underscores the importance of attending to individual sleep requirements. Prioritising rest allows couples to wake up rejuvenated, invigorated and emotionally attuned to nurture their relationship.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Establishing physical boundaries, such as separate sleeping quarters, can help couples set healthy boundaries across various facets of their relationship, fostering autonomy, independence and mutual respect.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Contrary to conventional thinking, opting to sleep separately necessitates open and transparent communication, comprehension, and mutual consent within the relationship. Engaging in conversations about the reasons for such a sleep arrangement can cultivate empathy, problem-solving capabilities and a stronger bond between partners.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Stop losing sleep over losing sleep’ with cognitive behavioural therapy</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Valentina Tudose, a relationship expert and certified hypnotherapist, explains that the tradition of bed-sharing among couples traces back to ancient times, when early humans sought safety and warmth by remaining together.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Throughout history, the majority of individuals resided in cramped, chilly quarters shared with at least one other person, hence it is ingrained in our beliefs that couples must share a bed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Evidence from numerous studies reveals that affectionate couples who share a bed experience more REM sleep and feel heightened security and closeness to their partners, resulting in reduced levels of anxiety and depression.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/11/2bf28bca-766f-4460-a211-6051232dad2b_3dded319.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nevertheless, she emphasises that some couples encounter significant disparities in their sleeping preferences, which can negate the advantages of sleeping together.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She says the decision to have separate bedrooms is not necessarily a reflection of a relationship’s health but can serve as a valuable tool in specific situations. Separate bedrooms can help prevent irritability and improve patience, reducing unnecessary conflicts that may arise from issues like snoring or bedtime habits.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Furthermore, she points out that separate sleeping arrangements can be especially beneficial for parents, allowing one partner to rest while the other attends to the needs of a nursing baby.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It can also inject variety and excitement into a couple’s intimate life by breaking the routine of sharing the same bed every night.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How good sleep benefits heart health, and 5 tips for a better night’s rest</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Tudose cautions against using separate bedrooms as a solution for deeper relationship issues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If the decision to sleep separately stems from a sense of disconnection or a desire to create physical distance out of discomfort, it may indicate underlying problems within the relationship, such as a lack of communication or unresolved conflicts, she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Hong Kong, where space is at premium and many people do not have the luxury of a spare bedroom to sleep in, Tudose says couples will need to try to create their own versions of a sleep divorce.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In a city where most residents reside in relatively compact apartments, often shared with other family members, the idea of separate bedrooms can pose a significant challenge that demands thoughtful compromise.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In instances where sleep preferences are influenced by factors like ambient noise or room temperature, practical solutions such as using earplugs, eye masks or investing in mattress covers with electronic temperature control can make a difference,” she says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Trouble sleeping?

How, what and when to eat</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Moreover, when differing sleep schedules are the issue at hand, couples can consider compromises such as opting for two single beds instead of one double, and using technology such as silent alarms to minimise disruptions when one partner needs to rise early.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Importantly, Tudose emphasises that if sleep separation hints at deeper underlying relationship issues, merely changing sleeping arrangements is unlikely to resolve the core problems. Seeking guidance from a relationship coach or counsellor can be instrumental in identifying the causes and crafting effective solutions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is crucial to acknowledge that each relationship is unique, and strategies that prove beneficial for one couple may not necessarily apply to another.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prioritising transparent communication, mutual respect and a keen understanding of each other’s needs form the bedrock of a resilient and thriving partnership, regardless of whether partners opt for shared or separate sleeping arrangements.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Luisa Tam is a Post editor who also hosts video tutorials on Cantonese language that are now part of Cathay Pacific’s in-flight entertainment programme.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiucilsGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaCofKK%2B06KapZ1faH92hJVqaGirmKTCrbCMsqauZZeawW6%2Fy56cqWWUnsOwvsKeZKmqn6h6orrDZpqopqNiwK2xxKmgp59dqLKxrdGaq55lkpqxs7vOpqpmr5iesKl5wpqlZp2mmrtursSnnJ%2BhpGKwsMHPpZys</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kellie-pickler-tough-lyrics.html><span>←</span><span>Kellie Pickler, Tough Lyrics Uncovered</span></a>
