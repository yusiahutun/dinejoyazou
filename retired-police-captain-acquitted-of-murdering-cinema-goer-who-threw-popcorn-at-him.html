The bullet went through her finger and pierced her husband's lung and heart, killing him.</p><p>Reeves claimed to police at the time Oulson had "stuck him in the face with an unknown object"; he removed the 380 semi auto handgun from his pocket and shot him because "he was in fear of being attacked."</p><p>The affidavit also states that "witnesses advised they did not observe any punches being thrown."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f090391d-2834-4ef4-8fc7-1e65bf30a3d1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f97f6ca4-48c6-4c76-9b26-5f64a407b9a2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/87/5by4/2022/02/23/8764a2e1a54a4216b4ff549d6cc28fbb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube/Twitter</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dad of Reporter Shot Dead by Colleague on Live TV Turns Footage Into NFT</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>During the nine-day trial, Reeves' Defense attorney Richard Escobar had argued that the then 71-year-old — a "decorated law enforcement officer who had countless hours of training in the use of force, in the assessment of danger, and the risks that take place when we are faced with a dangerous encounter" — was genuinely in fear he was about to get beaten up.</p><p>He claimed Oulson had been aggressively leaning over a chair toward him and had thrown a cellphone at Reeves' head; again no witnesses reported seeing a phone being thrown.</p><p>"I truly thought this was the end of the line for me," Reeves testified during the trial, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tampa Bay Times</a>. "I thought at the very least I would be seriously injured, if not killed."</p><p>“I didn't want to shoot anybody. I came to the theater with my family to enjoy a movie, not to be attacked by some guy that's out of control."</p><p>Prosecutor Scott Rosenwasser told the court that despite Reeves claiming he didn't know what had hit him, three witnesses testified hearing him say something about "throwing popcorn in my face" before he fired the fatal shot.</p><p>"'Man killed over popcorn toss' — that sounds like a sensationalized headline, something you'd read in big, bold type at a newsstand," Rosenwasser said in his closing argument. "But in this case it's absolutely, unfortunately true."</p><p>But ultimately, the jury of four men and two women took three-and-a-half hours to decide it was justified self-defense.</p><p>Outside the court, Reeves smiled and laughed to reporter's questions, as he described what was a "very trying time" for him and his family.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#CurtisReeves</a> speaks after verdict.
