It’s no wonder why <a href=# id=auto-tag_taurus data-tag=taurus>Taurus</a> is one of the best zodiac signs in bed. Taurus’ compatible signs are usually those who can match this sign’s need for pleasure—thanks to its planetary ruler, sensual Venus. As the second sign of the zodiac, earth sign Taurus (born between April 20 and May 20) is known for being a homebody and a lover of creature comforts. So, let’s talk about the very best <a href=# rel=nofollow>sex positions for Taurus</a> lovers!</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-0=processed>This slow, sweet, grounded approach often translates to languorous, soulful sessions between-the-sheets for the Bull. Taurus owes much of their romantic, sensual style to their key planet Venus (which rules beauty and love).</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_taurus.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>As a fixed sign, the Bull has a tendency to get stuck in a rut, opting for <a href=#>the same positions</a> or scenarios time and again. They’re drawn to whatever is comfortable and bolsters feelings of security and stability with their partner.</p><p>Here are five <a href=# id=auto-tag_sex-positions data-tag=sex-positions>sex positions</a> that can elevate a Taurus’ lovemaking routine, plus a few toys to spice ’em up.</p><p class=p1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

Taureans have a rep for being lazy—or simply just taking their time to get going—so they’ll love the chill vibe of this position, perfect for sexy, slow-paced Sunday mornings. Plus, it allows for the partner doing the penetration to caress any and every one of their lover’s erogenous zone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-22-at-1.16.17-PM.png><h2>The Rocking Horse</h2><p><b>How to do it:&nbsp;</b>A more intimate version of traditional Cowgirl/Cowboy, Partner #1 begins by sitting with their legs extended. Partner #2 then lowers themselves on top of Partner #1, wrapping legs around their torso. Both partners can place their hands behind their back for extra support, and then Partner #2 can control the tempo, which is matched by Partner #1.</p><p>A Bull will most definitely love this equus-themed position, which gives lovers the ability to not only make eye contact but enjoy all kinds of sensual touch—from caressing one another’s hair to face to neck (Taurus’ ruling anatomy!) and chests. If neither partner has a penis, <a href=# rel=nofollow>a dildo</a> will definitely get the job done.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/taurus-sex-positions-zen-pause.jpg><h2>The Zen Pause</h2><p><strong>How to do it:&nbsp;</strong>Taureans abhor being rushed and love making something extremely pleasurable last for as long as possible, so this “break” position is a perfect choice for the earthy sign. The gist: Partners get onto their sides and face one another with legs intertwined and chests pressed together, as the penetrating lover remains inside their partner the whole time. After having the opportunity to cool things down, sensual touch and kissing is sure to bring the moment back to a major boiling point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-22-at-1.21.17-PM.png><h2>The Glowing Juniper</h2><p><strong>How to do it:&nbsp;</strong>The Glowing Juniper takes the cowgirl position and makes it far more relaxing and languorous for the partner being penetrated. Partner #2 lies on their back with her legs outstretched, and Partner #1 (doing the penetration) faces them with their legs stretched out. Partner #1 can lean back into a pillow or against a wall for more support and then lift partner #2’s hips to penetrate theirs.</p><p>This deeply sensual position gives Partner #1 the ability to kiss, caress, and thoroughly love on Partner #2. Adding in <a href=# rel=nofollow>a clitoral stimulator</a> will only up the intensity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/taurus-sex-positions-tight-end.jpg><h2>The Tight End</h2><p><b>How to do it:</b> Doggy style gets a subtle but powerful tweak in this position, which simply requires that the partner being penetrated (Partner #2) presses their legs tightly together between Partner #1’s knees. This makes for an even more intensely intimate experience—something a Taurus will never turn their nose up at—and Partner #1 has the ability to let their hands roam all over Partner #2’s body.</p><p>– By Mareesa Brown.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcH2RaWtwcWVkr6a%2F02aqnrBdpby0tdOipqerXZu8s3nTmqyrraNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./452547-10-prayers-sunday-school-teachers-students.html><span>←</span><span>10 best prayers for Sunday School teachers and students</span></a>
