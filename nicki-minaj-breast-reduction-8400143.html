So — love your curves, and love your non-curves. There’s nothing wrong with any of it.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Minaj also opened up about being at “peace” with her current body after welcoming her son, whom she refers to as Papa Bear, in Sept. 2020.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I just looked at a video that I posted on Instagram when I was 25, and I would fucking pay to look like that right now,” Nicki shared. “But today I can say that I’m at peace with who I am and how I look.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, “I have to say this as a Black woman, though. I’ve made certain choices for my son, to not give him sweets and candy and juices, because of illnesses like diabetes that run in our community. I’m not in favor of body positivity if it means unhealthy bodies. That’s bull. It’s not believable, so let’s stop pretending.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Minaj’s insights come years after notably spoke out about body representation in the music industry ahead of the 2015 VMAs, spurring a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>now-infamous feud</a> with Miley Cyrus. The rapper also seemed to touch on that event in the interview, explaining, “When I hear the word mean, I think about the core of who the person is. I always tell people that the difference between being mean and being a bitch is that bitch passes. Bitch comes and goes. Mean is who you are.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nicki continued, “I could be the biggest bitch, at the height of my bitch-ness, but if the person I may be cussing out at that time needs something from me, I’m going to give it to them. I have to be able to look in the mirror and be okay with myself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zaKapKFdoravrclmmaudkajBbr7EnaycrJmku26Ek2lnamxj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./musc-noir-rose.html><span>←</span><span>Narciso Rodrigeuz Musc Noir Rose Is In Stock at This One Retailer</span></a>
