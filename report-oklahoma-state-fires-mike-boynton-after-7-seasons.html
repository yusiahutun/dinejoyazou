The Cowboys finished 12-20 overall and 4-14 in the Big 12 this season, which ended Tuesday with a 77-62 loss to UCF in the first round of the conference tournament. Oklahoma State lost its last six games and eight of 10. "For seven years, Coach Boynton has led this program and represented this university with class," Oklahoma State athletic director Chad Weiberg said. "We're grateful for the genuine passion and care he has for the student-athletes on our team. Unfortunately, the desired results have not followed. Therefore, it is time to part ways and begin a new chapter. We wish Coach Boynton and his family the very best." Boynton, 42, leaves Stillwater with a 119-109 record (51-75 Big 12) that included 20-win seasons in 2017-18, 2020-21 and 2022-23. The Cowboys made the 2021 NCAA Tournament as a No. 4 seed before losing in the second round. They played in the NIT in 2018 and 2023. It was the first head coaching job for Boynton, who was an assistant for former Cowboys coach Brad Underwood in 2016-17. He was previously an assistant at Stephen F. Austin, his alma mater South Carolina, Wofford and Coastal Carolina. Oklahoma State announced it has begun a national search for Boyton's replacement. --Field Level Media</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKugpL%2B1v46nmK2hn6OurXvRnqeoqqRivKy4wKGmppldqMGiwMRmnaKqlah6rrXKnmSbp6mjwbC6jJqdrZ2iYoRuv8Saqqimo2Sus8DInKOel5Znsnitw25sZpqSmoRugZSdamZwkmewbrGXbGtqcWRqgKevxWefraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./537379-how-mauricio-umansky-worth-richer-kyle-richards.html><span>←</span><span>How much is Mauricio Umansky worth?
