Orders for changes of words were sent back from London to Los Angeles,” he wrote.</p><p>However, the author writes that the most important demand was in her very last scene, her wedding to Mike.</p><p>The Palace reportedly ordered no photographs to be shot of Meghan in her wedding dress, and “between filming, she was always to wear a jacket over the dress.”</p><p>Meghan’s fictional wedding dress was vastly different to the one she wore at her royal wedding. In the show, she wore a sleeveless floral number.</p><p>In real life, she wore a more plain, long-sleeved dress, which a huge veil, designed by British fashion designer&nbsp;Clare Waight Keller, artistic director of the fashion house&nbsp;Givenchy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-960063256-1024x693.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-and-harry-could-be-making-a-return-to-tv>Meghan and Harry could be ‘making a return to TV’</h2><p>Although the Duchess of Sussex departed from Suits, since leaving the royal family, the couple has appeared in their own <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary, and it looks like they could be returning to the small screen.</p><p>It’s been reported that they’re in talks to <a href=#>star in the Kardashians</a>, as publications report momager Kris Jenner is eager to get them on screen.</p><p>“It’s no coincidence that the Kardashians all move in the same circles as Meghan’s new circle.
