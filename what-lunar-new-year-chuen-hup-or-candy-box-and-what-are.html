The type of container was a common fixture in wealthier households, filled with snacks for guests. Over time, the box became a common feature of Lunar New Year, so the word cheun was adopted because of its meaning and&nbsp;phonetic similarity to zan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A typical chuen hup&nbsp;has eight compartments – a number associated with wealth in Chinese culture&nbsp;– but it can have anywhere between four to 12 compartments. And before candy became a common product in the supermarkets, the box was filled with Chinese dried sweets, fruits, nuts and seeds – all of which have their own auspicious symbolism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/09/0eb7268d-4db2-48de-96f8-45f4503bae06_81bcb7a7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chinese words for sugared dried coconut and coconut sound the same as grandfather and son, so having those foods in the box means&nbsp;three generations coming together to bless the household with health and longevity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The words for dried mandarins or kumquats, meanwhile, share the same phonetics as the word for gold. This is also why the fruits are featured in Lunar New Year art and decorations, when they aren’t being eaten as snacks.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/09/f97bdfe6-5d23-4233-800e-e2ac0d0cbcd4_81bcb7a7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Melon seeds are one candy box treat that the kids might not be as interested in, and that are more typically enjoyed by older adults and grandparents. But they are actually central to the auspiciousness of the box, since the words for melon seeds sound the same as money or success, meaning the act of taking the seeds from the box is akin to achieving success or making money in life.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Finally, lotus seeds are associated with bearing lots of children and dried lotus roots symbolise love and the possibility of finding a spouse&nbsp;– a must for households with a lot of eligible members seeking marriage. The snacks also feature in candy boxes during weddings.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
