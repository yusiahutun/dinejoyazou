Rather than singing the Star Spangled Banner, the US national anthem, the <a href=#>music</a> star opted to sing Lift Every Voice and Sing, a hymn that is typically coined as the ‘black national anthem.’ Andra, 39, told The Hollywood Reporter she hadn’t performed the national anthem in so long as she <a href=# rel=nofollow>wanted to perform</a> Lift Every Voice and Sing first.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-andra-day-on-why-she-wanted-to-perform-black-national-anthem-at-the-super-bowl>Andra Day on why she wanted to perform ‘black national anthem at the Super Bowl</h2><p>Talking to THR, Andra Day <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a> why she hadn’t performed the US national anthem in a long time but chose to sing the ‘black national anthem’ at the Super Bowl. She said she had wanted to perform Lift Every Voice and Sing. The hymn, which was written and composed in 1900 by James Weldon Johnson and J. Rosamond Johnson respectively, is often called the ‘black national anthem,’ and although she was “nervous” to perform it, she said it was an “honor, truly, to represent our ancestors, the people who came before us, the people who truly sacrificed.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Grammy</a> winner said: “I will tell you, truthfully, I have not done an anthem in a while because the thing I kept saying is that, ‘I do not want to do it again until I’m able to sing Lift Every Voice and Sing.”</p><p>Andra said it was “incredible” to follow singers such as Alicia and Sheryl Lee Ralph, both of whom have sung it at the sporting event, was “incredible.”</p><p>“And what I loved about this song, my mom was looking at the lyrics and she says, ‘This is a hymn.’ And that’s what people forget. You know, because people do get up in arms sadly about it. But I don’t think it will always be that way.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> continued: “It’s kind of crazy even just saying it’s over. I mean, I’ve been so nervous and looking forward to it at the same time since November when we got the news. So it’s funny, I still feel nervous about something that happened. But I also feel elated. I feel grateful, and honestly I’m just in this place of gratitude, to God, to every member of my team, to everyone here. It felt like on the field people today chose joy. And that’s a really beautiful thing.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-people-praise-andra-s-performance>People praise Andra’s performance</h2><p>Taking to X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) people were quick to celebrate Andra’s performance of the ‘black national anthem’ at this year’s Super Bowl.</p><p>Another person penned: “She sounded so beautiful!
