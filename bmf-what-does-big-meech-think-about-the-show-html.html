The Starz drama follows the rise and fall of the Flenory brothers. Demetrius “Big Meech” Flenory (Demetrius “Lil Meech” Flenory Jr.) and Terry “Southwest T” Flenory (Da’Vinchi) were born and raised in Detroit. They began selling drugs as teens before becoming two of the biggest drug traffickers in the country.</p><p id=par-2_23>The drama is based on <a href=#>the Flenorys’ real-life experiences</a>. But how does Big Meech feel about the show and his son portraying him?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lil-Meech-BMF.jpg><h2 id=h-how-accurate-is-bmf>How accurate is ‘BMF’?</h2><p id=par-3_57>Big Meech and Southwest T were excited to do the show. Therefore, Detroiter and creator Randy Huggins wanted BMF to be as accurate as possible. “I took some liberties, but everything there is based on a story,” Huggins told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Urban Hollywood 411</a>. “Obviously, you can’t have people’s names in there. Obviously, some of the places may have changed.”</p><p id=par-4_80>However, Huggins wanted to make sure that every character was some version of an actual living person. “I don’t think there’s a character in there, that I hadn’t heard of,” he said. “I may have to take a creative liberty to make an art pop a little bit more. I may have to take a creative license to make a scene funnier than it may have been, but that’s just part of telling a story. This is not a documentary.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-what-does-big-meech-think-about-the-show>What does Big Meech think about the show?</h2><p id=par-5_63>There has been a ton of talk about BMF. In fact, some of the Flenory brothers’ former associates are non-too pleased with it. Former Black Mafia Family artist Bleu Davinci accused 50 Cent of using a snitch to get the rights to the story. He also issued a warning to the executive producer about how he might be portrayed on the show.</p><p id=par-6_37>However, it looks like both Big Meech and Southwest T are very happy with the crime drama. In response to Davinci, 50 Cent shared a screenshot of a message that Big Meech sent to Lil Meech.</p><p id=par-7_92>“Keep in touch so we can talk about the 3rd&nbsp;and 4th&nbsp;episode and whatever you out there doing all positive vibes,” Big Meech wrote via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Complex</a>. “I really love 50 for helping us make all this happen for us it’s like he the only one to sincerely come thru and put us on the 100 percent legitimate successful path and he never owed us shit but gave us ‘everything’ when almost all the sports and entertainers I’ve known most of my life never spoke up or helped us get on the path legitimacy!”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-lil-meech-learned-a-lot-about-himself-portraying-his-father>Lil Meech learned a lot about himself portraying his father</h2><p id=par-8_44>Since Big Meech has been incarcerated since Lil Meech was a kid, he’s had to stay connected with him through phone and visits. Growing up in Florida, Lil Meech did not experience Detroit in the same ways that Big Meech and Southwest T.</p><p id=par-9_105>However, the actor says getting the opportunity to portray his father has been a learning experience for him. “I learned a lot about myself; I learned that I had a lot of my dad’s traits without even me knowing,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Observer</a>. “My family members were telling me that they see him in me. Some of my family members got to come on set and actually get to watch us in action, and they were just in awe, tearing up. It was a beautiful moment, so I believe that everybody loves it and loves how they’re being played and love the whole story within itself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvrrKMsJ%2BarF2ZvKa%2FjJugoGWdmrKktIytn6Kmm2Kuo7vUrWStoJViwKm71mefraWcZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tamara-mellon-engaged-michael-ovitz.html><span>←</span><span>Tamara Mellon and Michael Ovitz engaged</span></a>
