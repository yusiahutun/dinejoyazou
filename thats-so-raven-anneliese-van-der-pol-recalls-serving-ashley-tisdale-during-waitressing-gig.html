Hi!' She was so uncomfortable. ... Like, I'm fine, girl!"</p><p>Romano chimed in to share her thoughts about Tisdale, telling van der Pol, "I grew up with Ashley. I don't know her anymore."</p><p>"These younger kids that came after us with Disney. God love them, but I think we're tougher," Romano, 39, added of Tisdale, 38.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>van der Pol starred in the Disney Channel series That's So Raven, which ran from 2003 to 2007. She reprised her role as Chelsea Daniels in the spinoff series Raven's Home, which she appeared in for four seasons until last year.</p><p>On the podcast, the Broadway star did not reveal when she had her alleged encounter with Tisdale and when she was working in the restaurant industry. However, van der Pol said she worked at "several" New York City restaurants, including Salvation Burger, Salvation Taco, and Tavern on the Green.</p><p>"I was really proud of myself. You had to do a lot of multitasking," she recalled, adding, "But the disappointment, the look, the drop of faces when [people would] recognize me was truly gut-wrenching."</p><p>She continued, "It's almost like I had to say, I'm ok. I'm actually really happy that I don't have to audition and that am doing something that I know I'm good at. I know when I clean a table or bring a meal that I can do that, and there won't be any mistakes. I won't be judged. Essentially, I kind of was judged."</p><p>Like van der Pol and Tisdale, Romano is also a Disney Channel alum, appearing in the series Even Stevens as well as voicing the titular character in the animated series Kim Possible.</p><p>Romano and van der Pol's first episode of Big Name Bitches dropped one day after they released the trailer, above.</p><p>The podcast's description reads: "Disney Channel icons Christy Carlson Romano and Anneliese van der Pol finally team up to become some Big Name B*tches.
