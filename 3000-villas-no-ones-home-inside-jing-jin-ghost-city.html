All that's missing, it seems, are the people.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One resident, Guo Huaxu , who is in his 60s, said there were nearly 400 villas where he lived, but only eight to 10 houses were occupied in autumn and winter. "It's a bit better in spring and summer, but still no more than 20 houses are occupied," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tianjin's Baodi district government, together with Hong Kong-listed property developer Hopson Development began construction of the project in 2002. Four years later, the State Council approved Jing Jin City as one of 11 satellite cities for the metropolis - an eco-friendly town offering leisure activities that was close to Beijing and Tianjin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2013/09/09/961b184d263edac543017a94cfa3cff4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A representative for Hopson portrayed the community as a work in progress, saying many of the villa owners were wealthy executives who rarely had time to visit, and the occupancy rate was climbing. The project would take time, said Zhao Yuting, Hopson's regional general manager for Tianjin, arguing it takes more time to build a city than a mere development.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But experts say that in such "new" cities - Ordos in Inner Mongolia and Shenmu in Shaanxi for example - infrastructure and economic opportunities fall behind the pace of property development, making it difficult to attract residents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wandering along the main street is a lonely affair. Most of the shops leading to the city centre are mere shells. A woman who rents one as her temporary home said she started working as a gardener four years ago, but had never seen a shop stay in business for long.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"There was a pet shop, but it soon closed," she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Outside the gates of the village communities sit empty shops with large, broken signs - some read hair salon or gym. Zhang Jun , a cleaner, said they were put there to make the area look more lived-in.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A few minutes walk past the Kai Xuan Men lies the sprawling, 800-room Hyatt Regency hotel. Towering like a drab castle in the sunset, the hotel was almost deserted apart from a dozen or so staff and a few guests making preparations for a product fair.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two hotel employees said there were usually 100 to 200 guests at any one time, and the number could double at weekends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2013/09/09/2cb2b01f241d06d7e0c884c2d0efa02d.jpg><a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2013/09/10/jingjincity1_1.jpg></span></a>Zhao Zongsheng , who operates an unregistered taxi outside the colleges, said the city was almost dead because there were no amenities, and the commute to Beijing or Tianjin was too far. "It only suits those who have retired, but are not too old," Zhao said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the projects sales centre, staff said most of the villas had been sold, but owners rarely visited. Half of the 53 square kilometres the project occupies had yet to be developed, and there were plans for 4,000 additional villas, said salesman Yang Kang . Most owners bought the homes for retirement, holidays or as an investment, Yang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a blaze of publicity in the first years after the city was approved by the State Council, the Baodi government announced its plan for a city eventually stretching 258 square kilometres - the same size as central Tianjin.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hopson Development has invested more than 20 billion yuan in the project, according to Zhao said at least 1,000 villas had been sold, and the average occupancy rate had grown by 10 to 15 per cent in the past year. But most of the owners were government officials or senior executives, who seldom had time to visit, which lowered the occupancy rate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2013/09/09/9ef54b0438266a161471381e48e7a417.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhao said the company was looking at a plan to establish a street dedicated to bringing in new businesses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We are talking with international chain stores such as KFC and McDonald's, as well as other famous brands including the Tang Polo Club," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We are not just building houses, but a city instead. It's not that we can create a city within 10 years," Zhao said. The company said there were plans for more facilities, including the Tianjin Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fu Wei , a research director with Shanghai-based Hanyu Property, said Jing Jin City was one of many examples of large developments that had sprung up in the wake of projects like Shanghai's Pudong New Area.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"They copied these successful models, but ended up finding their own conditions, including attracting industry and people, did not match the model," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A survey of 12 provinces and autonomous regions by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) found that each city-level government had erected at least one such project, the reported last month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2013/09/10/jingjin5.jpg><a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2013/09/10/jingjin6.jpg></span></a>Compared with thriving districts in China's great cities, these lifeless urban areas had no established industries, and people were unwilling to move there given the lack of job opportunities and poor infrastructure.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Qiao Runling , deputy director of the NDRC's China Centre for Urban Development, said governments should be wary about projects like Jing Jin City for two reasons: they occupy large tracts of farmland, and local governments are facing high financial risks because of huge construction costs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"In many new cities, the homes have been sold but lie idle," he said. "It's totally different from what we imagine a real city should be."</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: City has everything - but people</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyivtOimqWdX2aAcYORbW1oa2BlfW7CyKWjmqtdo7xuu82eqmagn6KybrXNrKCdnV2ftq%2BzjKOgp2WXnby0wIycoK2x</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./write-win-if-you-could-start-new-trend-gen-z-what-would-it-be-round-8.html><span>←</span><span>Write to Win: If you could start a new trend for Gen Z, what would it be?
