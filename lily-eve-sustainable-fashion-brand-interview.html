The story of sustainable brand <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>LilyEve</a> truly is the wholesome content you to see today.&nbsp;</p><p id=eO3A450wXhV data-wc=36>Lily Clempson, founder of the eponymous label, graduated from Parsons School of Design in New York in 2019. Shortly after completing her studies, she found herself making face masks to raise money for Food Bank NYC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/68752b6c0939-3310118014864881134894036240736845326827393n.jpg><p id=eKOgFuFs0M0 data-wc=96>When demand for masks increased, she looked for someone local to help her with the production process in East Hampton, New York. When she arranged to meet Michel (pronounced like 'Michelle') on April 27th 2020 a then 86-year-old man was not quite who she expected to meet. &nbsp;Fast-forward three years and their unexpected, but instant bond created the foundations for the most unique independent brand currently on the market. Their wholesome partnership doesn’t stop there though. Michel now lives alone since his partner, Wayne, passed away 12 years ago. Lily’s family are now his primary caregivers.</p><p id=eySHyRCofZ data-wc=17><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Spring fashion 2023: How to recycle your clothes for a spring clear-out according to an expert</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eh--9NMX5fO data-wc=11><strong data-gid=etemJXGBFoF>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>5 Fashion Editors share their pre-loved picks of the season</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/20ecec9a8e90-29739443931308662504997595173998273411355407n.jpg><p id=elvW7o3XAY data-wc=58>“I always say that if I had not met Michel there would be no LilyEve, he has been the best mentor and teacher I could have asked for,” Lily tells <strong data-gid=e2dl5JvTglk>Hello! Fashion</strong>. The brand up-cycles designer towels and blankets to create one-of-a-kind jackets, shorts and accessories from bags to hair scrunchies and delivers new pieces every single week.&nbsp;</p><p id=e2e2V48vkp data-wc=61>Despite the success of LilyEve, Lily admits that owning a brand – particularly one with such a strong sustainable ethos– isn’t always easy. “I wish people knew how much time and effort goes into creating a sustainable fashion brand, in this day and age of consumerism it’s hard to not be swayed into mass producing, or going for the cheaper fabric”&nbsp;</p><p id=esNK2ZoVEA data-wc=9><strong>MORE</strong>: <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How to recycle beauty products: the need-to-know guide</a></strong></p><p id=eincunl1PwK data-wc=15><strong>&nbsp;READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>How to clean your leather handbag in 4 simple steps according to an expert</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/f8cc2dfaf45a-1179558786164984059601902260937366994323286n.jpg><p id=e0lKES7TfL data-wc=32><br>But, the proof is in the pudding &nbsp;- or the delectable upcycled Hermes blanket - that it is possible to sustain (pun intended) an eco-conscious brand that produces the most incredible pieces.</p><p id=e6wtYcDA-RR data-wc=26>Their designs are fun and eccentric and their ethos is planet-friendly in the chicest way possible. But it’s their story that makes their brand absolutely unique.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>LilyEve on… Michel</strong></h2><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=efMSNUxYDlO data-wc=59>Over 30 years ago, Michel and Wayne owned a successful womenswear shop in East Hampton where they sold Michel’s couture suits, jackets and dresses. “He has helped shape all of our current styles,” Lily explains. “We work with his vintage jacket patterns that he used for his own women's clothing store, and modify them slightly to feel more LilyEve.”</p><p id=eidQf0mIb6P data-wc=94>But how do they combine the sartorial tastes of two different generations? Lily believes this is actually the key to making their pieces timeless; “I think what makes us different from other independent fashion brands is the partnership that Michel and I have. Michel has a very traditional, classic taste, whilst mine is a little more colourful and modern - so by combining the two, we end up creating pieces that we hope appeal to everyone. Our jackets have a timeless shape to them, whilst the placement of the prints are bold and attractive.”</p><p id=e-vVaM1mYfD data-wc=34>“We are creating garments that are truly one of a kind pieces, that we hope can be passed down through generations and that continue to be that one stand out piece in your wardrobe.”</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>LilyEve on.. Sustainability to succeed</strong></h2><p id=eFLwtD2W_jB data-wc=25>“I source my materials through any resale sites, auction houses, estate sales, etcetera. I am always looking for the next towel or blanket.” she explains.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_IOJJKidmD data-wc=73>Aside from her label’s drool-worthy, individual designs and her unique partnership with Michel, she attributes environmental friendliness as another reason for the brand’s success. ”Unlike larger fashion brands, we have no leftover fabrics whatsoever - every inch of the towel or blanket is used whether that's for hats, bags, patch pockets etc - so we are able to create new pieces from what we have left which would have otherwise been thrown away.”</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=ejQxs9EPmBF data-wc=38>Eco-consciousness is also the core of the brand because of Lily’s wholehearted passion: “it's the way the whole fashion industry should be heading. There’s so much waste in this industry, and in my opinion there really shouldn't be.”</p><p id=eBsBucgRVIz data-wc=35>“I think it’s more important to spend time making one unique piece that someone can invest in, and feel good about their investment than purchasing large quantities of something that will not last you forever.”</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>LilyEve on.. The challenges of a sustainable fashion brand</strong></h2><p id=e477fb0UoLRg data-wc=66>As with any start up or personal pursuit, she admits running the business isn’t always easy, particularly with a sustainable brand: ”It’s also sometimes challenging trying to source your material. Since I’m not purchasing fabric by the yard or having it made for me, I’m constantly trying to keep up with demand by sourcing enough towels and blankets, which are rarely easy to find in quantity.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/2ec2a1063c75-lilyeveselects-101216x1824cropcenter.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>LilyEve on.. The brand’s future</strong></h2><p id=e9K1-zdzpPZO data-wc=45>Large fashion brands who want to be more sustainable? This one’s for you: “I would love to see LilyEve partnering with larger luxury brands in the future, to help them up-cycle their deadstock fabrics and leftover clothing - into LilyEve one of a kind pieces.”&nbsp;</p><p id=ezuZNwpSvz data-wc=21><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5NxcGpsZmS5qrjYZpyvnV2owrTAwKKlmpqcmnqnrdKhoKimXZe%2ForrDZqCnrJWnw6qx1mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-island-2018-georgia-steel-16875133.html><span>←</span><span>Love Island's Georgia Steel has VERY famous dad</span></a>
