It was also ordered to pay out 2.92 billion yuan in 130 new enforcement notices.</p>Analysts said it is not easy to find a buyer for the building, as the reopening of the border with mainland China has not yet driven significant office-leasing activity amid <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a glut of office space</span></a>.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Two Chinese property firms unable to repay debt as sector woes continue</span></p></a></h3>A <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">high office-vacancy rate</span></a> continues to affect the leasing market on Hong Kong Island, and rents have not rebounded in the first half, Knight Frank said earlier this month.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By 2025, about 1.83 million sq ft of new office space will enter the Hong Kong office market, primarily in Central and Wan Chai. With the vacancy rate in Central still at a high level and ample supply over the next 18 months, there is downward pressure on rents, Knight Frank said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The consultancy added that in the short term, some landlords might reduce rents to attract tenants, but the reduction is likely to be less than during the pandemic. It expected office demand to remain subdued in 2023, with overall rents on Hong Kong Island to fall by 3 to 5 per cent for the whole year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtflr%2B1tcKlnGhrYmeCdX%2BWaJqhoZ6WeqbCxKueq5membK0eceopaBlm6S7qHnHnpidqaWWv7Wx0axkq52dlravv4yarJysmaS7bq7LqJqkZZqWsKx5zJpkpaGeoLKlecSnq6KsqWK0psDSZqWapZmjtA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-enigmatic-facts-about-james-macarthur.html><span>←</span><span>15 Enigmatic Facts About James MacArthur</span></a>
