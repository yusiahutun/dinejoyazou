"We thought you'd feel a little bit safer this way, man."</p><p>As Wicks inspects his new desk, he stares at the camera and&nbsp;deadpans, "Just so you know I can't make any ... I'm on- directional. That's my boy band name, One Directional." Wicks is a in a neck brace and can't move his head in any set direction too quickly.</p><p>While traveling to Mardi Gras on Feb. 27, a car containing all three America's Morning Show hosts and their producer, Glenn Johnson,&nbsp;<a href=#>flipped over at least twice</a> and landed in water. They were transported by ambulance to a hospital in Hattiesburg, Miss., and while Bentli, Kelly Ford and Johnson were released, Wicks was held overnight.</p><p>Wicks was told he was lucky to be walking and talking — he suffered a skull fracture and a cervical vertebrae fracture in the C2 region, according to emergency room doctors.</p><p>“What does this mean? It means I’m lucky I’m alive and not paralyzed,” Wicks <a href=#>shared</a>&nbsp;after the accident.&nbsp;“Good news. I’m not.
