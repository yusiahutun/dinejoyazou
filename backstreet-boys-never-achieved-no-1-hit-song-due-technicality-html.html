While many will argue about which one was the best, there’s no doubt they all had smash hits in their chart-topping heydays.
Despite their enormous popularity, Backstreet Boys never ascended to the peak of the Billboard charts due to a technicality.
  Six top-10 hits were pretty impressive for Backstreet Boys Anyone who was a teenager in the ‘90s and early 2000s can recall a Backstreet Boys title."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The act had six top 10 hits.</p><p id=par-4_49>“Shape of My Heart” was the last of their songs to climb the charts, from their fourth album, “Black & Blue.” Although not technically a breakup song, it was definitely an “I’m sorry” song for the band. It spent 20 weeks on the charts, topping out at No. 9.</p><p id=par-5_56>“Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely” earned <a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a> a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 2000 version of the awards show. Yeah, it was a breakup song for sure. It reached No. 6 on the top 100 Billboard chart after spending six months above 100.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Backstreet-Boys-Quit-Playing-Games-With-My-Heart.jpg><p id=par-6_31>“Everybody [Backstreet’s Back]” showed everybody that their first album wasn’t a fluke. The first single on their sophomore outing made it to No. 4 after spending 22 weeks on the charts.</p><p id=par-7_32>From “Backstreet’s Back” came the song “All I Have to Give”, which spent 21 weeks on Billboard rising to No. five. This was the band’s third top 10 single upon its release.</p><h2 id=h-one-song-made-it-to-number-2-on-the-billboard-hot-100>One song made it to number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100</h2><p id=par-8_49>“Quit Playing Games With My Heart” climbed the <a href=#>highest for Backstreet Boys</a>, ascending to No. 2 while spending an impressive 43 weeks (two months short of a full year) on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The single alone sold 2 million copies in the U.S., according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_28>But this song wasn’t the one that played games with the No. 1 spot on the charts.

It’s one of several surprising artists who never had a bona fide No. 1 hit.&nbsp;The reason comes down to a technicality.</p><p id=par-11_59>The single did have three successful weeks atop the Billboard Radio Songs airplay chart. It spent nine weeks (non-consecutively) at No. 6. However, inexplicably, the studio didn’t release <a href=#>“I Want It That Way” as a single</a> until it soared up the charts. At the time, Billboard tracked the Hot 100 by combining radio airplay and sales of the single.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-12_68>By the time the song peaked, the band missed out on a huge opportunity to claim the No. 1 spot for several weeks in a row. There is no telling if fans would have had it their way if the single was released sooner. The song garnered three Grammy nominations, so clearly, enough people in the music industry felt the song was worthy of a No. 1 slot.</p><p id=par-13_36>The boy band can claim a No. 1 record, at least to this point. Backstreet Boys have sold the most albums of any boy band in history at <a href=#>130 million albums</a> worldwide.
