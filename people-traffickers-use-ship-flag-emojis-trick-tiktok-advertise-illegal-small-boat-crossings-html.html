Earlier this year, Border Force chiefs claimed that advert blocks had led to a decrease in crossings, particularly from Albania. But traffickers are circumventing the problem.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One advert says: 'Boys ready for journey tonight. Maximum 25 people on (emoji of a small boat).' Another features the word 'Rruge' – Albanian for 'road' – with an emoji of the British flag and a pointed finger, superimposed on a photo of a red phonebox and the Houses of Parliament. In the caption space underneath are emojis of a boat, lorry, plane, the Union Flag and salute.</p><img id=i-162f429dbbf013f4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/29/21/73755829-12352401-image-a-2_1690661792291.jpg height=765 width=634 alt="Last night, Natalie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover and Deal, called on TikTok to prove it was taking people-smuggling seriously (File Photo)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Last night, Natalie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover and Deal, called on TikTok to prove it was taking people-smuggling seriously (File Photo)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In other adverts emojis of the English, British and French flags are used instead of words to signify a journey's start and end points.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The adverts also promise would-be migrants that they can meet King Charles and will get good jobs once in the UK.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All the posts we found were removed from TikTok, and the accounts that posted them were banned, after we approached the firm.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A border security source said: 'Smugglers are one step ahead at every stage.
