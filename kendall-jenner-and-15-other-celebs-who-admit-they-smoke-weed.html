But following a vocal chord surgery, Miley says she has been sober -- both from weed and drinking.</p><p>"I don’t smoke anymore, and I'm sober. I've been sober, pretty much the vocal surgery kind of did it for me because I just learned so much about the effects. You're just taught it's not really the drinking, it's the staying up all night. Once you have your drink, you end up smoking," Miley said in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview </a>with Joe Rogan.</p><p><strong>3. Lady Gaga</strong></p><p><a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> has had a long-term relationship with weed, at one point <a href=#>admitting</a> that she thought she was "addicted" to marijuana which she was using to help her deal with anxiety.</p><p>Then in her 2017 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">documentary </a>"Gaga: Five Foot Two," it was revealed that Gaga was now using the drug to manage the chronic pain she experiences from fibromyalgia.

She says she started smoking to help deal with anxiety, depression and other health issues when she was younger.</p><p>"I've been smoking weed for a good minute. When I was younger, I dealt heavily with anxiety and depression and weird eating habits and stomach problems. It was making me miserable. CBD oil and weed were the only things to help me," Bella told <a href=#>Forbes</a>.</p><p>Now she even has her own line of cannabis products, teaming up with Glass House Group to launch her brand Forbidden Flowers.</p><p><strong>5.

While filming "The Beach Bum" with Snoop Dogg, Matthew thought he was smoking joints stuffed with oregano. Instead, Snoop had swapped out the prop for real weed.</p><p>"We do the scene and it's about an eight-minute take, [which is] a long take if you're passing a joint back and forth and you're smoking hardcore to the heels of your feet. So the scene goes on and right after the scene I just feel like, 'Man, I'm not sure that was a prop…' And I look over and Snoop goes, 'Yo, Moondog, that wasn't prop weed, that was Snoop weed,'" Matthew said on "<a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Live</a>."</p><p>He added, "I didn't speak another word of English, really. It was one of those highs where I didn't really catch my breath until 5:30 the next day."</p><p><strong>7. Brad Pitt</strong></p><p><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> admits he used to be a stoner when he was younger but he got sober later in life.</p><p>"I'm really, really happy to be done with all of that... No [it wasn't hard to quit]. Back in my stoner days, I wanted to smoke a joint with Jack and Snoop and Willie. You know, when you're a stoner, you get these really stupid ideas. Well, I don't want to indict the others, but I haven't made it to Willie yet," Brad told <a href=#>GQ</a>.</p><p><strong>8. Kate Hudson</strong></p><p><a href=#>Kate Hudson</a>, who once shared she may have smoked weed with Matthew McConaughey on the set of "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," says she's even gotten high with her famous parents Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.

"And I know this sounds cheesy but around the time I stopped smoking, I started doing a lot of yoga and I just excelled because I was putting all of my energy into that, I wasn't doing anything else. And I was like, 'Wow, what if I was doing this with everything?' And then it really made me think, 'What have I been missing?

"And then I ran into [Willie Nelson] and that was that. Willie never felt too good about me quitting. And he kept trying to get me to not quit. We'd be playing poker and he'd pass me a vape pen, and I'd say, 'Willie, man, I don't do that anymore.' And he'd act surprised, like it was news to him. Anyway, Willie passed me the pen after I'd won this huge pot. I was in a celebrating mood, so I snatched the pen from him and took a long draw. And Willie smiled at me and said, 'Welcome home, son.'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8fee1ff3-80a4-40f0-9b51-696e7be49b5d data-container-ref=toofab:article:37f24f0a-e4eb-40d1-b082-f36dc34123fb data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c9/5by4/2020/05/25/c924951c97674654b0241b59d8194732_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Goldie Hawn Spills on 'Scary' Drug Trip and Standing Up to Harvey Weinstein Over 'Bad' Script</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>15.
