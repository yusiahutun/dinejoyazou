Standing on the banks of the Colorado River as we all took in its magnificence and beauty, I was reminded of the urgent need to preserve and protect this vital lifeline. Thank you Tillie for bringing us all together and showing us that we can advocate on nature's behalf. Let's be the change we want to see!"&nbsp;</p><p id=eXUA6X_Igf data-wc=30>Demi's fans were blown away by her youthful appearance, with one responding: "Incredible Demi what's your secret to staying so young and beautiful?" A second said: "Your beauty never fades."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4152ccad771e-demi-moore-bikini.jpg><p id=eGI1Gav9yRF data-wc=32>A third added: "Ι love DEMI and she is in her best age of having fun and looking GORGEOUS." A fourth penned: "Bloody hell. She looks constantly amazing! And happy actually." 2</p><p id=eYM8Ngm8Wj data-wc=40>There's no denying that Demi looks incredible, which she attributes to Bikram yoga, dancing, and a strict raw vegan diet. However, she forced herself to take a four-year break from exercise after she began to let working out "consume" her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4fb1d9978960-demi-moore-red-bikini.jpg><p id=eUFBF_oiiSZ data-wc=38>Demi revealed in her memoir, 'Inside Out' that her obsession with keeping fit began in 1992 when she was cast opposite Tom Cruise in 'A Few Good Men'. "I didn't feel like I could stop exercising," she wrote.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3usoDehhQD data-wc=49><strong>"Getting in shape for that movie launched the obsession with working out that would consume me over the next five years. I never dared let up."&nbsp;</strong>For Demi's role in 1996's 'Striptease', she took her diet to the extreme to make sure she looked good on a stripper pole.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/186c693ae7b5-demi-moore-charlies-angels.jpg><p id=eCk5lXChOmv data-wc=38>"For breakfast, I would measure out a half cup of oatmeal and prepare it with water, then for the rest of the day I would have only protein and some vegetables — and that was it," she confessed.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMz_pz36FP data-wc=56>Reflecting on her unhealthy mindset, Demi told Elle&nbsp;in 2010: "I had an extreme obsession with my body. I made it a measure of my own value. I tried to dominate it, which I did, and I changed it multiple times over. But it never lasted and ultimately it didn't bring me anything but temporary happiness."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/73718d6cd63a-347434236183762329350281344193942131732611758n.jpg><p id=efoOLtVJNBm data-wc=38>Admitting she was now happy with her body, she added: "Does being thin resolve anything? No. The irony is that when I abandoned that desire to dominate my body, it actually became the body that I'd always wanted.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHQw9TGXAf data-wc=25>"But it only happened when I stopped trying to control it. At the end of the day, this kind of obsession is pointless and meaningless."</p><p id=eqqs76mCIlB data-wc=31><strong>Get the lowdown on the biggest, hottest celebrity news, features and profiles coming out of the U.S. <a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our HELLO!
