Brenda, then 25, was a newly-divorced single mom of two working her way through nursing school. She'd started line dancing with her mom, who'd insisted she needed to get out more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I did not want to meet a man," said Brenda. "I was going to nursing school. I was discharged from the Marine Corps, a single mom, on food stamps. It was a tough time in my life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Kurt and Brenda encountered each other at that bar in 1992, neither was looking for nor expecting to find love. The universe, however, had other plans. In a 2017 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with ESPN</a>, the couple explained that they were paired up together during one of the dances and exchanged names afterward. They stayed until the bar closed.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Timing, fate, whatever you want to say, that dance ends with us partnered up," Kurt recalled to PEOPLE. "I asked her to keep dancing and that's really how this whole thing started, a chance meeting when she didn't want to go out, I didn't want to and somebody forced us to go out, and all of this came from it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The next morning, Kurt showed up at Brenda's parents' house asking to meet her children.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I wouldn't believe it unless I lived it," Brenda said.

Before their line dancing encounter, Brenda was newly divorced from her first husband. The couple welcomed Zach in 1989, but when he was just 4 months old, his father accidentally dropped the baby in the bathtub — leaving Zach blind and with brain damage.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Every dream that you have just gets crushed, because now it's just survival," Brenda told PEOPLE, who was working in Marine intelligence at the time. "But in the Marines, I learned that you do what you have to do. Zach and I didn't know what our future was, but we were going to do this together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brenda took a hardship discharge from the Corps to care for Zach. While she was pregnant with her daughter Jesse, her husband cheated on her and they divorced before the baby's arrival, mere months before she met Kurt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Kurt showed up unexpectedly at a skeptical Brenda's door the day after their encounter (he'd gotten her address from a mutual friend), Zach, then 3, "grabbed my hand and pulled me into the house," said Kurt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I walked out and he was wrestling on the floor with Zach, the way he looked at my son with pure love, no judgment, no expectation, just loved him, that's all it took for me," Brenda said. "He fell in love with my kids before he fell in love with me. That's when I knew he was worthy of being in our lives, of our love."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1996-a-deadly-tornado-inspires-kurt-to-propose-to-brenda></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1996: A deadly tornado inspires Kurt to propose to Brenda</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Cassidy Araiza</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1996, Brenda's parents were tragically killed when a tornado leveled their Arkansas home.

"So, when this happened, it just kind of put things in perspective. What's important? What do I want? Are you going to be along for this ride? So it was more of a shift in [Kurt]." Brenda went on to say that she knew Kurt was the one for her, but that during those first four years he wasn't sure whether he felt the same way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kurt explained that he hadn't taken the relationship too seriously at first. He was dreaming about playing in the NFL during college and what the couple had at the time was great but not necessarily the biggest priority until they were faced with this tragedy. "That was a key moment for me in a lot of different ways to really settle me and go, 'Alright, figure this thing out right now because you got a family here that needs you or needs someone to step in and help them move forward.'"<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-october-11-1997-kurt-warner-and-brenda-meoni-get-married></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>October 11, 1997: Kurt Warner and Brenda Meoni get married</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>@WarnerBrenda/Twitter</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kurt and Brenda got married on Oct. 11, 1997, in Cedar Falls, Iowa.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with Access</a> on Oct. 6, 2010, the couple shared that faith and spending time together has made their marriage successful.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We have to make our marriage a priority," Brenda said.

He led the team to the Super Bowl in 2000, where he was also named Super Bowl MVP.
