She looked so divine and so good in her signature red suit, all hope for the rest of us seemed lost. After being raised on photos of her running across the beach on Baywatch, I found a suit similar to hers in high school—only to be left confused when I didn’t instantly transform into an earthbound goddess after slipping it on.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s just something about the simplicity of a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g7186/best-one-piece-swimsuits/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="one-piece swimsuit" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">one-piece swimsuit</a>. And for most of my life, I was convinced that something was possessed only by Anderson, and that the rest of us just didn’t have it. She made a name for herself by showing skin, but she made the simple red suit look sexy because she oozed her signature confidence even while more covered-up. Chasing that subtle sensuality felt impossible to me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Until I went to Iceland.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Nordic region is not a place typically associated with swimwear. When I packed my bag for a trip there last December, I entirely forgot to bring a suit, despite knowing I would be visiting the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/blue-lagoon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="famous blue lagoon" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">famous blue lagoon</a> near the capital of Reykjavík.

But the four colors that are available include “Elf Queen,” a light purple whose name was enough to convince me that if I wore it, I would emerge from the water with the eccentric ethereal energy of Björk. The scoop-neck design has a distinctive logo cross strap and high leg, and the suit is crafted out of a chlorine-resistant material from Italian fabric manufacturer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.carvico.com/en/swimwear-fabrics/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Carvico class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Carvico</a>. Despite my failure to fall in love with similar suits in the past, this one felt different.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Perhaps it was that, like everything 66°North makes, the suit was designed with purpose. I have more than a handful of bikinis and one-pieces that instantly invite wardrobe malfunctions after encountering a singular large wave. I’ve even relegated some of them to a special pile, only to be worn when I’m certain I won’t be moving much on the beach, or swimming at all. But the Alda is something I could easily do laps in, without a worry in the world. And the ease with which I could wear it gives me that confidence I’ve been searching for in similar swimsuits.</p><img alt="66 north swimsuit" title="66 north swimsuit" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-6580-60-649941983113b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Tara Gonzalez</span><p>Wearing the Alda one-piece in the blue lagoon</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I wore it to the blue lagoon out of necessity—I had nothing else with me—but I have since packed it on every seaside vacation or beach weekend I’ve gone on. I’ve also found myself wanting to wear it out as a bodysuit, styled with chunky cardigans in the winter and long maxi skirts in the summer. It’s the most unexpected swimwear staple I have, which I think also lies at the core of its appeal. And it’s the type of thing high-school me was desperately searching for but didn’t realize could only be found 2,737 miles away, in a place where I least expected it.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
