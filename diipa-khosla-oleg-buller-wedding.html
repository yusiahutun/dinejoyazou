"I arrived there the first day, and I was a few days late because I have an Indian passport so I had some visa issues,” the now 28-year-old explains. “So pretty much all the new students had made their friend groups and everything. My parents dropped me off at the main reception, and the very first guy I saw is now my husband."</p><img alt="Photograph, Yellow, Ceremony, Bride, Wedding, Tradition, Peach, Photography, Event, Wedding dress, " title="Photograph, Yellow, Ceremony, Bride, Wedding, Tradition, Peach, Photography, Event, Wedding dress, " width=3600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/6i8a5800-1549581557.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Zohaib Ali</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dutch-American Oleg, now 32, was in his final year and the university’s student body president. He invited Diipa to take a seat in his office while she got her bearings. “I still very clearly remember sitting in his office that first time and him just trying to be kind and polite and talk to me,” she remembers. “I was this new student, completely intimidated and being a little bit of a bitch to him because I was like, ‘oh my god, I look shit, I have no makeup on, and he looks like James Dean. Shit, shit, shit.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the pair connected on Facebook, their social lives didn’t intersect much. “He had his own group of friends, and I had mine,” Diipa says. “But there was always a curiosity. I would know when he would enter a room, you know? [But] he was notoriously known to be a player, he had all these rumors about him… I was just like stay clear of him, he's not your kind of guy.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Five years later, when Diipa’s career as an influencer was taking off in London, and Oleg had started his career as a diplomat for the Dutch Foreign Service, he sent her a birthday message on Facebook. A dialogue began and they continued the conversation in Messenger. “He was like, whenever you're back in Amsterdam I'd love to take you out for real.” Diipa was interested, but Oleg’s university reputation made her suspicious, so it wasn’t until around six months later that the date finally happened.</p><img alt="White, Photograph, Yellow, Fashion, Dress, Photography, Temple, Tradition, Event, Costume, " title="White, Photograph, Yellow, Fashion, Dress, Photography, Temple, Tradition, Event, Costume, " width=948 height=1422 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/5z4a9691-1549633597.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Zohaib Ali</span></p><img alt="Mehndi, Pattern, Clothing, Bride, Dress, Design, Arm, Maroon, Brown, Hand, " title="Mehndi, Pattern, Clothing, Bride, Dress, Design, Arm, Maroon, Brown, Hand, " width=2000 height=1620 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-bazaar-bride-diipa-diego-01-1549637790.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Zohaib Ali</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was perfect,” Diipa remembers. “Italian restaurant by the canal on this late summer evening… We already knew on that first date it was nothing normal, you know? This was already very magical and we were connecting on every level.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At one point during their dinner, Oleg recalled their first meeting. “He said, ‘You were wearing that hoodie, and you were sitting inside my office and being a complete bitch to me.’” Diipa was stunned. “He met, I think about a thousand students that week. So for him to remember… He said, ‘I don't know, you just left a little impression on me.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair were smitten, and officially dating within about a month. “We just connected on everything,” Diipa says. “I was from India, from this traditional Indian family, and he was born in Boston and raised in Amsterdam, but for some reason our foundations and the way we looked at the world were the same.”</p><img alt="Entertainment, Performance, Performing arts, Event, Pink, Performance art, Dance, Stage, Dress, Fashion, " title="Entertainment, Performance, Performing arts, Event, Pink, Performance art, Dance, Stage, Dress, Fashion, " width=3600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ai8i0314-1549633817.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span><p>Diipa & Oleg’s Sangeet, where the soon to be married couple and their friends dance in a series of choreographed performances.</p><img alt="Event, Performance, Fashion, Performing arts, Abdomen, Dance, Stage, Human body, Dancer, Performance art, " title="Event, Performance, Fashion, Performing arts, Abdomen, Dance, Stage, Human body, Dancer, Performance art, " width=2670 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fihfotografie-diipa-oleg-day-1-16-1549633906.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It wasn’t long after that Oleg mentioned marriage. “It was New Year's Eve, and he comes up to my ear and he's like, ‘This is the year I'm going to ask you to marry me’ – and this is, mind you, three months after being official.” Diipa didn’t take Oleg seriously, but in mid-2016 they started planning a trip to her native India together during the holidays, as Oleg had never been.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As their travel date neared, their calendars started filling up. But less than a week before they were set to fly, Oleg called from his then post in Baghdad with bad news. “He tells me, ‘My ambassador just called me in, and it turns out I have to go on a secret mission and I can't tell you anything about it—it's state secret. I'm going to have to skip the first couple of days of India,” Diipa remembers. “Of course I was bummed, but he was so convincing. I mean, there's a lot of things he can't tell me about his job,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Diipa took her sister as her plus-one to an event in India while Oleg was off working. “It was a 45-minute drive and we finally see this amazing hotel on top of a hill,” she says. They were greeted by paparazzi at the entrance, as well as the hotel manager, who told her she was very late and that he must rush her to the event. “I'm like, ‘Where's the dinner? Where are the people? I don't hear anything.’ Finally we enter this courtyard, and there's candles all around it. And there's someone playing the flute in the background. And then I walk up into the courtyard, and at the end of it I see this guy in a tuxedo. And it's quite dark, but then I go up a little closer and I look up again and [Oleg] was standing right there.”</p><img alt="Maroon, Sari, Tradition, Interaction, Bride, Dress, Ceremony, Textile, Marriage, Formal wear, " title="Maroon, Sari, Tradition, Interaction, Bride, Dress, Ceremony, Textile, Marriage, Formal wear, " width=1865 height=2797 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/5m4-9083a-1549635102.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><img alt="Maroon, Clothing, Red, Beauty, Bride, Headpiece, Pink, Sari, Jewellery, Dress, " title="Maroon, Clothing, Red, Beauty, Bride, Headpiece, Pink, Sari, Jewellery, Dress, " width=2000 height=1620 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-bazaar-bride-diipa-diego-03-1549637905.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotographie</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Oleg had staged a surprise engagement that was six months in the making, spanning multiple countries and countless people, including Diipa’s manager and her family. “I was just in utter shock, I kept asking, ‘Wait, you're not in Baghdad? You're really here?’” Of course, Diipa accepted Oleg’s ring, which featured a diamond that had been in his family for five generations, reset by an Amsterdam jeweller especially for her. “It was the most shocking, beautiful proposal ever,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it came to their wedding, Oleg and Diipa had very different tastes and expectations. Diipa wanted a big celebration with both a traditional Indian ceremony and a European one, while Oleg had something smaller and understated in mind. “It was our friends who convinced us to have it in India,” Diipa says. “They were like, ‘Guys, come on, we've seen enough weddings in Italy and France. Can we get a crazy, big, fat Indian wedding?’”</p><img alt="Building, Tourism, Palace, Temple, Architecture, City, Historic site, " title="Building, Tourism, Palace, Temple, Architecture, City, Historic site, " width=2670 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fihfotografie-diipa-oleg-day3-718-1549581640.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair chose to host the wedding at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.fatehgarh.in/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fateh Garh Palace" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Fateh Garh Palace</a>, taking it over for the duration of the four-day event. “It had just enough rooms for our guests – we wanted it to be our own little utopia for four days,” Diipa says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They invited their 100 guests with invites from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/sketchdesignstudio/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sketch Design Studio" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sketch Design Studio</a> and recruited two wedding planners; <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ankit.in/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ankit class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ankit</a> to handle the organization, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.altair-decor.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alt Air" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Alt Air</a> to oversee the flowers and décor. The first day of wedding celebrations included a Mehendi ceremony, in which the bride's hands and feet are decorated with henna, followed by the Sangeet, a lively pre-wedding party with musical performances. Day two began with the Haldi ceremony, in which the bride and groom are covered with a turmeric paste by family and friends — the yellow hue of the spice is believed to purify the souls of the bride and groom-to-be.</p><img alt="Photograph, Clothing, Dress, Victorian fashion, Gown, Fashion, Brown, Headpiece, Wedding dress, Beige, " title="Photograph, Clothing, Dress, Victorian fashion, Gown, Fashion, Brown, Headpiece, Wedding dress, Beige, " width=2000 height=1620 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-bazaar-bride-diipa-diego-02-1549637972.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotographie</span></p><img alt="Yellow, Tradition, Bride, Interaction, Ceremony, Dress, Marriage, Event, Happy, Wedding dress, " title="Yellow, Tradition, Bride, Interaction, Ceremony, Dress, Marriage, Event, Happy, Wedding dress, " width=2400 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/6i8a6290-1549635138.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Zohaib Ali</span></p><img alt="Photograph, Green, Red, Pink, Ceremony, Yellow, Dress, Event, Tradition, Fashion, " title="Photograph, Green, Red, Pink, Ceremony, Yellow, Dress, Event, Tradition, Fashion, " width=3600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ai8i1135-1549635207.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Zohaib Ali</span></p><img alt="Tradition, Fashion, Photography, Stock photography, Art, Costume design, Fashion accessory, Headpiece, Style, Ceremony, " title="Tradition, Fashion, Photography, Stock photography, Art, Costume design, Fashion accessory, Headpiece, Style, Ceremony, " width=2000 height=1620 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-bazaar-bride-diipa-diego-05-1549645574.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After the Haldi, the bride and groom are separated. Diipa participated in the Chooda, an intimate Punjabi tradition in which the bride is given red and white bangles by her family to signify the start of her married life. Meanwhile, Oleg made his entrance on a white horse in a party-style procession called the Baraat. The pair were reunited for the Indian wedding ceremony, which was followed by a lavish reception. The third day of festivities comprised of the European wedding ceremony and a later reception dinner and dancing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Diipa admits that she and Oleg had completely different approaches to the planning process: “[Oleg] was always more concerned about the macro things, like, ‘Let's make sure people are fed, let's make sure they're sleeping well,’” and I was more, ‘What about the font of the name cards?’”</p><img alt="Dress, Fashion, Window, Textile, Formal wear, Outerwear, Photography, Tradition, Door, Fashion design, " title="Dress, Fashion, Window, Textile, Formal wear, Outerwear, Photography, Tradition, Door, Fashion design, " width=2670 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fihfotografie-diipa-oleg-day-2-465-1549635323.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><img alt="Bride, Skin, Tradition, Beauty, Eye, Headpiece, Jewellery, Design, Fashion accessory, Mehndi, " title="Bride, Skin, Tradition, Beauty, Eye, Headpiece, Jewellery, Design, Fashion accessory, Mehndi, " width=4000 height=2670 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fihfotografie-diipa-oleg-day-2-480-1549635451.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotographie</span></p><img alt="Photograph, Ceremony, Event, Building, Religious institute, Ritual, Place of worship, " title="Photograph, Ceremony, Event, Building, Religious institute, Ritual, Place of worship, " width=2670 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fihfotografie-diipa-oleg-day-2-630-1549635519.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><img alt="Rite, Tradition, Marriage, Ceremony, Event, Ritual, Sari, Design, Bride, Temple, " title="Rite, Tradition, Marriage, Ceremony, Event, Ritual, Sari, Design, Bride, Temple, " width=4000 height=2670 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fihfotografie-diipa-oleg-day-2-529-1549637865.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because there were multiple events taking place in the same venue, Diipa wanted each to have its own theme. “The Indian wedding dinner and reception had this very ethereal, white roses and gold theme, while the Indian wedding itself was very rich and very, very regal. Kind of like that Rajasthan, old Indian palace vibe,” Diipa explains. “We tried to source local flowers to help the community as well. So it was mostly from local vendors that would be outside temples or on the sides of the roads.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the European wedding, the look was more minimalist. “The European wedding was very south of France, nothing over the top because we’d had so much grandeur over the past two, three days,” Diipa says. “We went for local flowers as much as possible – we also got a lot of white roses from New Delhi if I'm not mistaken.”</p><img alt="Dress, Gown, Clothing, Photograph, Wedding dress, Shoulder, Bridal clothing, Bride, Bridal party dress, Fashion, " title="Dress, Gown, Clothing, Photograph, Wedding dress, Shoulder, Bridal clothing, Bride, Bridal party dress, Fashion, " width=2000 height=1620 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-bazaar-bride-diipa-diego-04-1549638020.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><img alt="Gown, Dress, Clothing, Wedding dress, White, Shoulder, Fashion, Haute couture, Bridal clothing, Bridal party dress, " title="Gown, Dress, Clothing, Wedding dress, White, Shoulder, Fashion, Haute couture, Bridal clothing, Bridal party dress, " width=2674 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fihfotografie-diipa-oleg-day3-559-1549635584.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With two wedding ceremonies across four days of celebrations, Diipa wore multiple bridal looks—nine in total—including a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pronovias.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Pronovias class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Pronovias</a> reception party gown and a 44lb skirt by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.aashniandco.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Aashni & Co" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Aashni & Co</a> for the Indian wedding reception.

Oleg has so many close friends. “It would just be 25 [people] standing next to him, and I just don't have 25 close girlfriends,” Diipa says. Instead, they had their siblings standing by their sides for the ceremony, though Diipa’s bridesmaids were identified by their <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://amsale.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Amsale class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Amsale</a> bridesmaids gowns.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the Indian wedding, all the bridesmaids (who wore <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://manijassal.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mani Jassal" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Mani Jassal</a>) and groomsmen (in Boggi Milano) were given different responsibilities. “During the Indian wedding, my bridesmaids walked me down the aisle and that was really special for them,” Diipa says. “[The groomsmen’s] main task was during the [part where the groom] comes in on a horse, is just to go crazy and dance around him.”</p><img alt="People, Event, Crowd, Performance, Audience, Design, Stage, Ceremony, Tradition, Pattern, " title="People, Event, Crowd, Performance, Audience, Design, Stage, Ceremony, Tradition, Pattern, " width=4000 height=2670 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fihfotografie-diipa-oleg-day-2-723-1549635984.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><img alt="Photograph, Red, Fashion, Dress, Yellow, Snapshot, Pink, Formal wear, Ceremony, Photography, " title="Photograph, Red, Fashion, Dress, Yellow, Snapshot, Pink, Formal wear, Ceremony, Photography, " width=2179 height=3268 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/6i8a7915-2-1549636065.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Zohaib Ali</span></p><img alt="Photograph, Yellow, Red, Ceremony, Event, Dress, Wedding dress, Happy, Formal wear, Wedding, " title="Photograph, Yellow, Red, Ceremony, Event, Dress, Wedding dress, Happy, Formal wear, Wedding, " width=4000 height=2670 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fihfotografie-diipa-oleg-day-2-748-1549636090.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Guests were entertained by local dancers and singers, as well as snake charmers and tarot readers. “Anything to do with that fantasy, Aladdin-ish life,” Diipa says. They kept the food largely traditional Indian too. “Every day had a different cuisine of India. So one day it was from the region where we were having the wedding, one day it was from the region where our family's from, Punjab, and then one day it was Hyderabadi.” But like many brides, Diipa didn’t have much opportunity to enjoy it. “I wish I got to enjoy it a little bit more, but I was too stressed out,” she admits.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple didn’t plan to have a first dance – a compromise because while Diipa’s family loves the drama of an entrance or a moment, Oleg’s family is more restrained in their taste. “For them, everything is 'make it understated,'” Diipa says. “They actually have this phrase in Dutch, ‘doe normaal’, which means be normal; like, can you not be over the top?”</p><img alt="Photograph, Ceremony, Wedding, Bride, Tree, Event, Lighting, Dress, Wedding reception, Marriage, " title="Photograph, Ceremony, Wedding, Bride, Tree, Event, Lighting, Dress, Wedding reception, Marriage, " width=2670 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fihfotografie-diipa-oleg-day3-975-1549636126.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">FIH Fotografie</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ultimately, the dance happened anyway. Oleg’s sister is a talented singer, and her gift was a performance for the couple. She instructed them to hold hands and look at each other while she sang, and at some point, they began dancing. “We forgot everyone else was there,” Diipa says. “It was very special.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As an influencer, photography and video footage of the wedding was very important to Diipa, though she admits she went a little overboard: “There was a point where I felt there were a too many [people], I think there were 10 in total,” she says. “Three were videographers [<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.musemotionpictures.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Muse Motion Films" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Muse Motion Films</a>] and one was a live editor so he would be editing every day.
