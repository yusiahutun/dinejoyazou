So, Richie and I had the opportunity to go up to his room,” the 62-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reminisced</a> on Jimmy Kimmel Live! “We walked into his hotel room — which was all done up in mirrors so he could dance — and they actually took a wall out between these rooms,” he surprisingly revealed.</p><p>As the trio became acquainted, they invited the King of Pop to ‘hang out’ with them on their floor, however, the Billie Jean star unfortunately didn’t partake in the party. BUT, he did send a representative on his behalf, who was, in fact, Bubbles.</p><p>“Unfortunately he didn’t come, but he [Michael Jackson] sent Bubbles the chimp as his representative,” Jon Bon Jovi recalled as he tried to suppress his laughter. “That was big. Bubbles comes down and wreaks havoc. Bubbles parties like a rock star.”&nbsp;</p><p>To Jimmy’s surprise, the Livin’ on a Prayer singer revealed the chimp was ‘running loose,’ revealing he was “jumping on the bed” and “putting on a show.”</p><p>In fact, the rock star recalled Bubbles was partying so hard that hotel management threatened to throw the band out of the hotel. What a night!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1338073770.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-bubbles-now>Where is Bubbles now?</h2><p>Almost 15 years after the passing of Michael Jackson, Bubbles now lives at the Centre for Great Apes in Wauchula, Florida, where he has been since 2005.</p><p>Although Bubbles is sadly without Jackson, he’s said to have monkey friends in the center, who go by the name of Oopsie, Murray, Mowgli, and Bo.</p><p>The apes are free to roam the 100-acre space, as staff at the sanctuary said he had a “sweet character”.</p><p>When he was a toddler, Bubbles was bought by MJ for the princely sum of $65,000, where he lived a life of luxury, accompanying his owner across the globe and on private jets.</p><p>However, when Bubbles turned 20, he became too large and aggressive for the singer to look after and relocated to a ranch in California, run by Bob Dunn.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aCcLnInJ%2BanZxit6Kvyqymp2Wjmru1eceiqmabmJ66sa3Ns5yeZZKqr6O4xKxkraddpa6zwNhmrqKsmGKvsLqMo6avoV2dsm68wKurop2UYrmqt8RmmGaqn5i4tMDAq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./latavia-roberson-19811101-html.html><span>←</span><span>LaTavia Roberson (Pop Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
