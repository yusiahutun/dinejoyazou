Primary sales supported overall market sentiment, surging 80.4 per cent month on month to 655 deals. The overall home price index also rose by 0.6 per cent in January, according to official data.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/08/25/AFP-TV_20220824_FIN_CHN_TransportTourism_32GZ6RF_en.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:14</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Hong Kong’s iconic Peak Tram set to return to service after year of renovation</p><p>Hong Kong’s iconic Peak Tram set to return to service after year of renovation</p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority in March <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">raised the city’s base rate to a 15-year high of 5.25 per cent</span></a>, after the US Federal Reserve increased its target rate by a quarter point to a range of 4.75 per cent to 5 per cent. However, Hong Kong’s major lenders did not follow suit. HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) kept their best lending rates unchanged at 5.625 per cent, while Standard Chartered kept its prime rate unchanged at 5.875 per cent.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pause in lending rates by the city’s three currency-issuing banks has boosted hopes that homebuying activity will continue to increase in the coming months, as mortgage rates are likely to stabilise. Sales of new and lived-in homes could hit 66,000 units this year, up nearly 50 per cent from 2022, according to market observers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Since the full border reopening earlier this year, the Hong Kong luxury residential market has seen signs of recovery across both transactions and leasing,” said Steve Lam, senior director, capital markets and investment services, Colliers Hong Kong. “Driven by mainland buyers, transactions in the primary market have gained momentum, with transaction prices holding up strongly.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Are China’s big spenders trickling back to Hong Kong’s home market?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For example, a few new projects in Kowloon have recorded transaction prices of over HK$50,000 per square foot. The ultra high-end market has also seen improved sentiment, with multiple single-lot houses reaching final stages of negotiations. We expect the luxury residential market to keep up the momentum and post even stronger growth in the second quarter.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vincorn’s Cheung, on the other hand, pointed to some “sluggishness” in the luxury property market.</p>Earlier this year, a four-bedroom luxury home in Mount Nicholson <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">resold at an estimated loss of about HK$130 million</span></a>. The home, in one of the most expensive luxury developments in Hong Kong, set a record for Asia when it sold for HK$519.9 million in 2019. It sold on January 27 to a buyer named “Yu Ye” for HK$390 million, about 25 per cent below the price “Li Jun” paid for it, according to official records.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtflr%2B1tcKlnGhrYmaDcYWVaKOusKWnxm7CyKWjmmWYpLuoecqopaCrXaWyoreMrZynnJWneqS71KWbZp6VqbCpecyumqFlpah%2Bc36UZqSipJyevK8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./514587-blueface-kids-how-children-american-rapper.html><span>←</span><span>Blueface kids: How many children does the American rapper have?</span></a>
